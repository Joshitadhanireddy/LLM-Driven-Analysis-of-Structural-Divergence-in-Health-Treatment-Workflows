# LLM-Driven Health Treatment Plan Recommendation
  As more patients use the internet to make medical decisions, the difference between professional and consumer health information online has become a serious public health concern. This paper compares treatment workflows for twenty health conditions across five major online health information sources, including both clinically focused and consumer-focused platforms. Using a combination of generative AI for treatment plan (workflow) structuring and NLP for quantitative analysis, we consistently observe low similarity between sources. The divergence shows that professional platforms prioritise aggressive clinical interventions, whereas consumer-focused platforms focus on self-management and general information. We propose a criteria-based framework to help users select the appropriate type of source for their health information needs.

  The code used for extracting treatment information, the extracted treatment data, the generated workflows, and the code used for workflow analysis are all available here.
