BENIGN PROSTATIC HYPERPLASIA (BPH) MANAGEMENT WORKFLOW (from WebMD-based plan)

1. Overall treatment options
   - Watchful waiting.
   - Medications (first-line for mild–moderate symptoms).
   - Supplements (with caution).
   - Minimally invasive procedures or surgery when necessary.

2. Watchful waiting
   - For mild, non-bothersome symptoms without complications.
   - Annual (or earlier) check-ins:
     * Track urinary frequency, urgency, weak stream, incomplete emptying, leakage.
   - Lifestyle tweaks:
     * Reduce evening fluids, caffeine, and alcohol.
     * Avoid OTC decongestants and certain antihistamines that worsen symptoms.

3. Medication therapy
   3.1 Alpha-blockers
       - Alfuzosin, doxazosin, prazosin, silodosin, tamsulosin, terazosin.
       - Relax bladder neck and prostate muscle → improve flow quickly.
       - Side effects: dizziness, fainting, headache, low blood pressure, retrograde ejaculation.
       - Avoid around time of cataract surgery due to surgical risks.
   3.2 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs)
       - Dutasteride, finasteride.
       - Block hormone driving prostate growth → shrink prostate over months.
       - Benefits: reduce risk of complications and need for surgery.
       - Side effects: erectile dysfunction, lower libido, retrograde ejaculation; lower PSA and may be linked to increased high-grade prostate cancer risk (monitor PSA carefully).
   3.3 Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor
       - Tadalafil (Cialis) for men with both ED and BPH.
       - Side effects: headache, flushing, back pain, nasal congestion, dyspepsia, visual changes.
   3.4 Combination therapy
       - Examples: finasteride + doxazosin; dutasteride + tamsulosin (Jalyn); alpha-blocker + antimuscarinic.
       - More effective symptom relief but more side effects risk.

4. Supplements (not first-line)
   - Saw palmetto, beta-sitosterol, pygeum, rye grass.
   - Evidence for symptom relief inconsistent or weak.
   - Always discuss with doctor due to interaction and safety concerns.

5. Procedural options
   - For refractory symptoms, complications (retention, recurrent infection, stones, bleeding, kidney damage), or preference.
   - Minimally invasive treatments and traditional surgery are available.
   - Choice guided by prostate size, comorbidities, and patient goals (not fully detailed here; see procedural workflow if needed).

6. Long-term management
   - Regular symptom assessment and PSA monitoring.
   - Reassess medication effectiveness and side effects.
   - Escalate to procedures if quality of life remains impaired.
