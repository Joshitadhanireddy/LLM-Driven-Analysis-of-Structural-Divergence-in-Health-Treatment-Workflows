HEMOPHILIA TREATMENT WORKFLOW (from WebMD-based plan)

1. Determine severity & type
   - Factor VIII (Hemophilia A) or Factor IX (Hemophilia B).
   - Mild: treat only for injury/procedures.
   - Severe: frequent bleeds → regular prophylaxis.  fileciteturn11file0

2. Clotting factor replacement
   - IV infusion to stop or prevent bleeding.
   - Types:
     * Plasma-derived factor.
     * Synthetic recombinant factor (safer, virus-free).  fileciteturn11file0
   - Long-acting products (Adynovate, Idelvion) reduce infusion frequency.

3. Targeted therapies
   - Emicizumab (Hemlibra): preventive for Hemophilia A (weekly SC injection).  fileciteturn11file0
   - Obizur: porcine factor VIII for acquired hemophilia A.  fileciteturn11file0

4. Adjunct medications
   - DDAVP (desmopressin): boosts factor VIII in mild hemophilia A.
   - Antifibrinolytics (tranexamic acid, aminocaproic acid).  fileciteturn11file0

5. Joint bleed management
   - Immediate factor replacement.
   - Rest + ice.
   - Physical therapy after swelling reduces.  fileciteturn11file0

6. Activity monitoring
   - Avoid high-injury risk activities.
   - Individualized based on hemophilia severity.  fileciteturn11file0

7. Complication prevention
   - Screen for inhibitor development.
   - Vaccination for hepatitis A/B (low past infection risk improved today).  fileciteturn11file0
