CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME TREATMENT WORKFLOW (from WebMD-based plan)

1. General principles
   - Condition typically progresses slowly.
   - Early treatment can slow or stop progression and shorten recovery.
   - Start with conservative measures, escalate to injections or surgery if needed.

2. Self-care (early/mild CTS)
   - Ice:
     * Apply to wrist or use ice bath for 10–15 minutes, 1–2 times per hour.
   - Positioning:
     * Gently shake wrist or hang over bed edge for night pain.
   - Warm water exercises:
     * Soak hand in ~100°F water; flex/extend wrist and fingers, several times a day.
   - Rest:
     * Reduce or pause activities that trigger symptoms.
   - Over-the-counter pain relief:
     * Aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen.
   - Note: These measures give short-term relief only; they do not cure CTS.

3. Wrist braces (splints)
   - Best for mild–moderate CTS.
   - Wear at night to keep wrist neutral; consider during triggering activities.
   - Trial for at least 3–4 weeks before judging benefit.

4. Activity and ergonomics
   - Avoid holding wrist in fixed flexed or extended positions for long periods.
   - Strategies:
     * Take 10–15 minute breaks each hour to stretch hands.
     * Adjust desk, tools, or workstation for neutral wrist posture.
     * Alternate hands for tasks where possible.
     * Use only necessary grip force; avoid over-gripping tools or pounding keyboards.
     * Maintain good posture; avoid rounded shoulders that worsen wrist mechanics.

5. Corticosteroid treatment
   - Oral or injected cortisone to reduce swelling in carpal tunnel.
   - Injection directly into tunnel can provide temporary relief.
   - Not a long-term cure; used as intermediate step.

6. Physical and occupational therapy
   - Stretching and strengthening exercises for hand and wrist.
   - Training in joint protection and task modification at work or home.

7. Complementary/alternative options (adjunctive)
   - Yoga: can reduce pain and improve grip strength.
   - Therapeutic ultrasound: heats tissues; mixed evidence but helpful for some.
   - Acupuncture: some report benefit though evidence is limited.
   - Always discuss with clinician before starting.

8. Surgery (carpal tunnel release)
   - Indications:
     * Moderate–severe CTS not improved after ~6 months of conservative care.
     * Significant functional impairment or nerve damage.
   - Techniques:
     * Open release: ~2-inch incision from wrist to palm.
     * Endoscopic release: two small incisions with camera guidance.
   - Goal:
     * Cut transverse carpal ligament to relieve pressure on median nerve.
   - Outcomes:
     * Most cases are cured with no recurrence.
     * Severe longstanding CTS may not fully resolve but usually improves.
