BELL’S PALSY MANAGEMENT WORKFLOW (from WebMD-based plan)

1. Prognosis overview
   - Most people recover fully, often without treatment.
   - Treatment focuses on speeding recovery and protecting the eye.

2. Early medical treatment
   2.1 Corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone)
       - Start as soon as possible after onset.
       - Reduce facial nerve swelling; speed return of function.
   2.2 Antiviral drugs (with steroids in severe cases)
       - Acyclovir or valacyclovir.
       - Limited benefit when used alone; sometimes combined with steroids.

3. Eye protection
   - Use lubricating eye drops or ointments to prevent dryness.
   - Wear an eye patch to keep moisture in and debris out.
   - Continue eye care until eyelid closure and blinking recover.

4. Physical therapy
   - Facial exercises and massage.
   - Aim to maintain muscle tone and improve facial coordination.
   - Gently practice movements across all facial regions.

5. Surgical and cosmetic options (for persistent deficits)
   - Consider if weakness or asymmetry lasts 6–12 months or more.
   - Options:
     * Cosmetic procedures to help eyelid closure or correct crooked smile.
     * Nerve grafts or muscle transfers for facial reanimation.

6. Recovery course
   - Symptoms worsen over first 48–72 hours.
   - Improvements typically begin over the following weeks.
   - Most regain near-normal facial movement by ~3 months.
   - Some may develop long-term issues (synkinesis, tightness, asymmetry) if nerves do not heal correctly.
