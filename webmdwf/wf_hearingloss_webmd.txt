HEARING LOSS MANAGEMENT WORKFLOW (from WebMD-based plan)

1. Determine type and cause
   - Conductive vs sensorineural vs mixed hearing loss.
   - Identify reversible causes (infection, wax, medication, structural problem) vs permanent damage.

2. Treat reversible causes
   - Infections: appropriate antibiotics.
   - Earwax blockage: removal with suction or curette by clinician.
   - Medication‑related: review and adjust ototoxic medicines with prescriber.
   - Structural or middle‑ear issues (otosclerosis, scar tissue, some Ménière’s disease):
       * Consider surgery or targeted medical therapy.

3. Long‑term amplification and assistive options
   3.1 Hearing aids
       - Primary treatment for permanent hearing loss.
       - Fit in or behind ear; tuned to individual hearing profile.
       - Set realistic expectations about sound quality changes.
   3.2 Assistive listening devices
       - Personal listening systems to focus on desired sounds.
       - TV‑listening systems to hear clearly without raising volume.
       - Phone amplifiers and captioned phones for landline and mobile use.

4. Cochlear implants
   - Consider for profound hearing loss with limited benefit from hearing aids.
   - Used in children and increasingly in adults.
   - Surgically implanted device bypasses damaged inner ear to stimulate auditory nerve.

5. Ongoing management
   - Regular audiologic follow‑up to adjust devices and monitor progression.
   - Counseling and rehabilitation to optimize communication strategies and quality of life.
