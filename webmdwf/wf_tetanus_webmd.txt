TETANUS TREATMENT WORKFLOW (from WebMD-based plan)

1. Diagnosis & care setting
   - Clinical diagnosis based on symptoms and vaccination history.
   - Admit to hospital for close monitoring and supportive care.

2. Core acute treatment
   2.1 Tetanus immune globulin (TIG)
       - Single IM injection.
       - Neutralizes unbound tetanus toxin.
   2.2 Wound care
       - Thorough cleaning.
       - Remove dirt, foreign bodies, and dead tissue (debridement) to stop bacterial spread.
   2.3 Antibiotics
       - Metronidazole or penicillin to kill C. tetani.
   2.4 Muscle spasm control
       - Sedatives such as diazepam.
       - Magnesium plus sedatives for autonomic instability (BP swings, tachycardia, hypothermia).

3. Supportive management
   - Airway and breathing support as needed.
   - High-calorie nutrition via feeding tube.
   - Minimize stimuli (light, noise, touch) to avoid triggering spasms.
   - Plan for physical therapy after acute phase to restore function.

4. Vaccination
   - Give tetanus vaccine even after illness (natural infection does NOT confer immunity).
   - Booster schedule:
       * Routine booster every 10 years.
       * Booster if contaminated wound and ≥5 years since last shot or status unknown.
