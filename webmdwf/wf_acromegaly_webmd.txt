ACROMEGALY TREATMENT WORKFLOW (from WebMD-based plan)

1. Treatment planning
   - Confirm diagnosis and staging.
   - Consider age, general health, tumor size/location, and symptom severity.
   - Combine surgery, medicines, and/or radiation as needed.

2. First-line: Pituitary tumor surgery
   - Indications:
     * Large tumor, especially if pressing on optic nerves or nearby brain areas.
   - Approach:
     * Transsphenoidal access via nose or upper lip to tumor at brain base.
   - Post-op assessment:
     * Recheck GH/IGF-1 hormone levels.
     * Imaging of surgical area.
     * Monitor early symptom improvement (often within days).

3. Medical therapy after (or instead of) surgery
   3.1 Somatostatin analogs
       - Lanreotide, octreotide, pasireotide.
       - Lower GH and IGF-1 levels.
   3.2 GH receptor antagonists
       - Pegvisomant.
       - Block GH action in tissues.
   3.3 Dopamine agonists
       - Cabergoline, bromocriptine.
       - Lower GH in some patients.

4. When surgery is not an option or is insufficient
   - Consider paltusotine (Palsonify):
     * Once-daily oral somatostatin-mimetic.
     * Lowers GH and IGF-1, may slow disease progression.

5. Radiation therapy (for residual tumor or persistent hormone excess)
   - Conventional fractionated radiation:
     * Daily treatments (weekdays) for 4–6 weeks.
     * Clinical effect may take 10+ years.
   - Proton beam therapy:
     * High-dose beam targeted to tumor, sparing normal tissue.
     * Several sessions; shorter overall course than conventional radiation.
   - Stereotactic radiosurgery:
     * Single high-dose treatment precisely focused on tumor.
     * Can normalize GH levels over several years (~5 years).

6. Long-term goals
   - Normalize GH/IGF-1.
   - Control tumor growth.
   - Relieve symptoms and prevent complications.
   - Adjust combination of surgery, medicines, and radiation over time.
