PROGERIA (HGPS) MANAGEMENT WORKFLOW (from WebMD-based plan)

1. Core disease‑modifying therapy
   - Lonafarnib (Zokinvy):
       * Farnesyltransferase inhibitor approved to slow disease course.
       * Improves weight gain, bone and heart health.
       * Extends lifespan on average by ~4.5 years.

2. Monitoring and research therapies
   - Ongoing research into:
       * Gene‑targeted therapies to correct LMNA variant.
       * Strategies to reduce progerin production.
   - Encourage participation in specialized centers/registries when possible.

3. Cardiovascular & systemic complication management
   - Daily low‑dose aspirin to reduce heart attack and stroke risk.
   - Statins and other lipid‑lowering drugs as indicated.
   - Anticoagulants/antiplatelets for clot prevention where appropriate.
   - Growth hormone to support height/weight in some children.

4. Symptom‑directed care
   - Physical & occupational therapy:
       * Maintain mobility, address stiff joints and hip problems.
       * Support independence with adaptive techniques.
   - Nutrition:
       * High‑calorie, nutritious diet; frequent small meals.
       * Work with nutritionist for individualized plan.
   - Hearing and vision care:
       * Hearing aids for hearing loss.
       * Regular eye exams and treatment of ocular issues.
   - Dental care:
       * Regular visits with dentist experienced in progeria.
   - Skin and bone monitoring:
       * Assess and treat skin and skeletal complications.

5. Interventional cardiology & surgery
   - Angioplasty and stent placement for narrowed arteries when indicated.
   - Valve replacement (e.g., aortic stenosis) in selected patients living longer with lonafarnib.

6. Supportive daily‑life strategies
   - Maintain hydration, especially during illness or heat.
   - Comfortable, cushioned footwear and inserts for foot discomfort.
   - Use of sunscreen (SPF ≥30) on all exposed skin, including scalp.
   - Home adaptations (lower switches, accessible fixtures, supportive furniture) to enhance independence.

7. Psychosocial and educational support
   - Encourage normal schooling and socialization; cognition is typically normal.
   - Provide mental health support and access to support groups.
   - Connect with organizations such as the Progeria Research Foundation for community and resources.

8. Long‑term goals
   - Slow disease progression.
   - Prevent or delay cardiovascular events.
   - Maximize comfort, independence, and quality of life for child and family.
