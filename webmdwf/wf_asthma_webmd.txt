ASTHMA MANAGEMENT WORKFLOW (from WebMD-based plan)

1. Core strategy
   - Combine short-term relief with long-term control.
   - Build an asthma action plan and know when to call the doctor or seek emergency care.

2. Quick-relief (rescue) treatment
   2.1 Short-acting beta-agonists (first choice)
       - Albuterol, levalbuterol, epinephrine inhalers.
       - Use for acute symptoms; if needed >2 days/week → reassess control.
   2.2 Anticholinergic bronchodilators
       - Ipratropium; reduces mucus and opens airways.
   2.3 Oral corticosteroids
       - Prednisone, methylprednisolone for severe attacks or flares.
   2.4 Combination quick-relief inhalers
       - SABA + anticholinergic in a single device.

3. Long-term preventive treatment
   3.1 Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) – cornerstone
       - Beclomethasone, budesonide, ciclesonide, fluticasone, mometasone.
   3.2 Inhaled long-acting beta-agonists (LABA)
       - Formoterol, salmeterol, vilanterol – always with ICS, not alone.
   3.3 Combination ICS/LABA (± LAMA) inhalers
       - Advair, Breo, Dulera, Symbicort, Trelegy Ellipta.
   3.4 Biologic therapies (severe asthma)
       - Omalizumab, mepolizumab, reslizumab, benralizumab, dupilumab, tezepelumab.
   3.5 Leukotriene modifiers
       - Montelukast, zafirlukast, zileuton (oral).
   3.6 Cromolyn
       - Non-steroidal inhaler; prevents trigger-induced swelling.
   3.7 Theophylline
       - Oral bronchodilator; less commonly used.
   3.8 Long-acting bronchodilators (e.g., tiotropium)
       - Add-on with ICS for persistent symptoms.
   3.9 Systemic corticosteroids
       - Short courses when other therapies fail to control attacks.

4. Medication delivery
   - Inhalers:
     * Metered-dose inhalers (aerosol) or dry powder inhalers.
   - Nebulizer:
     * Turns liquid meds into mist; used for young children, older adults, or those who can’t use inhalers well.

5. Non-drug interventions
   - Breathing exercises to reduce medication needs.
   - Asthma action plan with “green/yellow/red” zones:
     * Green – controlled; use regular meds.
     * Yellow – worsening; adjust meds per plan.
     * Red – severe; urgent treatment and emergency steps.

6. Trigger control
   - Identify and reduce exposure to:
     * Pet dander, dust mites, pollen, molds, tobacco smoke, cockroaches, cold air, indoor mold.
   - Use allergen-proof covers, hot-water washing, pest control, and smoke-free environments.

7. Allergy-driven asthma
   - Omalizumab (Xolair) for IgE-mediated asthma.
   - Immunotherapy (allergy shots or sublingual drops) to build tolerance over time.

8. Follow-up
   - Review control level, inhaler technique, adherence, triggers, and side effects regularly.
   - Adjust therapy step-up or step-down according to symptoms and rescue use.
