=== Management and Treatment ===

Your healthcare provider may recommend different options to treat your atopic dermatitis symptoms. This may include:

  - Identifying and avoiding triggers and allergens
  - Applying an over-the-counter, fragrance-free moisturizer (cream or ointment) to your skin at least twice daily
  - Using topical prescription medication as directed by your provider
  - Participating in allergen immunotherapy to reduce how many allergic reactions you have
  - Undergoing light therapy (phototherapy)


** Atopic dermatitis medications **


Two medications that your provider may prescribe to treat atopic dermatitis include:

  - Topical corticosteroids
  - Topical calcineurin inhibitors

Topical medications are creams or ointments that you rub on your affected skin in the same way you apply a lotion. You should use these medications as directed. They may have side effects if you overuse them.


** How can I manage atopic dermatitis symptoms? **


To soothe mild, itchy, dry and cracked skin from atopic dermatitis, you can:

  - Use over-the-counter anti-itch creams ( hydrocortisone )
  - Take allergy medication ( antihistamine ) as directed
  - Keep your skin moisturized with products that don’t contain perfumes or dyes, particularly immediately after a bath or shower
  - Trim your nails or wear gloves at night to prevent itching
  - Wear comfortable clothing that isn’t tight or scratchy
  - Use a humidifier to prevent dry air environments
  - Take an oatmeal bath (use colloidal oatmeal as directed in your bath water) to lock the moisture into your skin

The timeline varies from person to person after you start treatment. For example, you may notice itch relief shortly after applying a prescription medication to your skin. The rash may start to fade within days to weeks.

Since there isn’t a cure for atopic dermatitis, the rash generally comes back after treatment. This is why it’s important to pay attention to your triggers and make sure you’re avoiding them, if possible.

If you have any questions about what you can expect, talk to your provider.

Contact a provider if you notice changes to your skin that cause pain and discomfort. If you’re constantly scratching your skin and develop an infection (with swelling, pain and pus), your provider will help you treat it.
