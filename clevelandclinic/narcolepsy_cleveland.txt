=== Management and Treatment ===


--- How is narcolepsy treated, and is there a cure? ---


Narcolepsy is treatable but not curable. Treatments usually start with medications, but changes to your daily routine and lifestyle can also help. In general, narcolepsy responds well to treatment, which helps limit the disruptions that symptoms can cause.


--- What medications or treatments are used to treat narcolepsy? ---


Medication is the main method for treating narcolepsy. Most medications target excessive daytime sleepiness, but some target other symptoms, too. Possible medications for this condition include:

  - Wakefulness medications . These are usually the first line of treatment. Examples of these drugs include modafinil and armodafinil. These medications stimulate your nervous system, which can help reduce the severity or frequency of daytime sleepiness.
  - Amphetamines and amphetamine-like stimulants . Drugs like methylphenidate (better known under several trade names, including Ritalin®, Concerta® or Qullivant®) or amphetamine/dextroamphetamine combinations (better known by the trade name Adderall®).
  - Antidepressants . These medications may include serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) such as venlafaxine (commonly known by the trade name Effexor®), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like fluoxetine (better known under the trade name Prozac®), or tricyclic antidepressants like clomipramine or protriptyline (but these are less common).
  - Sodium oxybate . This drug can help you sleep and also reduces how often cataplexy happens. Most countries control this drug very tightly because of its effects, but it’s still used frequently for treating type 1 narcolepsy.
  - Histamine-affecting drugs . An example of this type of drug is pitolisant, a histamine receptor antagonist. Receptor antagonists are drugs that block specific chemicals in your body from attaching to cells. That slows down or prevents the cells from doing certain things.

While there are multiple treatment options for narcolepsy in adults, treatment options in children are very limited. Your child’s pediatrician or a specialist provider is the best person to tell you what treatment options are available or what they recommend.


** Complications/side effects of narcolepsy treatment **


Many medications that treat narcolepsy or its symptoms are more likely to interact with other drugs. High blood pressure (hypertension) and irregular heart rhythms are just two possible complications with stimulant medications of any kind. Sodium oxybate in particular is dangerous if combined with other drugs that dampen how your central nervous system works, and you should never mix it with alcohol.

In general, your healthcare provider is the best person to tell you what side effects, complications or medication interactions to watch for or avoid. They can tailor the information to your specific case and situation, accounting for your health history and personal circumstances.


--- How do I take care of myself or manage my symptoms? ---


You shouldn’t try to self-diagnose and self-treat narcolepsy. That’s because the symptoms of this condition happen commonly with other conditions like sleep apnea or epilepsy, which are also dangerous. This condition can also make certain activities like driving or swimming dangerous, so you should always see a healthcare provider for diagnosis and treatment.


--- How soon after treatment will I feel better, and how long does it take to recover from this treatment? ---


The recovery time or time to feel the effects of treatments for narcolepsy depends on many factors. Your healthcare provider is the best person to tell you what to expect in your case, including the timeline on when you should see the effects of medications or changes in your symptoms.
