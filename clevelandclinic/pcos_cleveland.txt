=== Management and Treatment ===

Your healthcare provider will determine treatment based on your symptoms, medical history and other health conditions, and if you want to get pregnant. Treatments can include medications, lifestyle changes or a combination of both.


** If you don’t plan to become pregnant, treatments include: **


  - Hormonal birth control: Options include birth control pills , patches, shots, a vaginal ring or an intrauterine device (IUD) . Hormonal birth control helps to regulate your menstrual cycle, some forms will also improve acne and help with excess hair growth.
  - Insulin-sensitizing medicine: Metformin is a drug used to treat diabetes. It works by helping your body process insulin. Once insulin is under control, some people with PCOS see improvements in their menstrual cycles.
  - Medications to block androgens: Some medications can block the effect of androgens. This helps control acne or hair growth. Talk to your healthcare provider about whether such treatment is right for you.
  - Lifestyle changes: Eating a nutritious diet and maintaining a body weight that’s healthy for you can have a positive effect on insulin levels.


** If you want to become pregnant now or in the future, treatment for PCOS includes: **


  - Drugs to induce ovulation (releasing an egg) : A successful pregnancy begins with ovulation. Certain drugs have been proven to induce ovulation in people with PCOS. The medications clomiphene and letrozole are taken orally, while gonadotropins are given by injection.
  - Surgery : A surgical procedure can help restore ovulation by removing tissue in your ovaries that produces androgen hormones. With newer medications available, surgeons rarely perform this procedure.
  - In vitro fertilization (IVF) : This is an option for people with PCOS when medication doesn’t help with ovulation. Your provider fertilizes your egg with your partner’s sperm in a lab before transferring it to your uterus.

While there isn’t a cure for PCOS, your healthcare provider can help you manage your symptoms. The effects of PCOS may change over time so that you become less aware of the condition. However, there isn’t a treatment that permanently cures it.


** Can you be in menopause and have PCOS? **


The hormone changes you experience during menopause often resolve the symptoms of PCOS. It doesn’t matter how old you are — if your symptoms affect your quality of life, talk to your healthcare provider.

Yes, you can get pregnant if you have PCOS. PCOS can make it hard to conceive while also increasing your risk for certain pregnancy complications, but many people with PCOS do get pregnant on their own. Your healthcare provider will work with you to develop a treatment plan to help you ovulate. Your treatment plan could include medication or assisted reproductive technologies like in vitro fertilization (IVF).

Talk to your healthcare provider to make sure you understand your treatment plan and how you can increase your chances of a healthy pregnancy.
