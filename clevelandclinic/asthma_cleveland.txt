=== Management and Treatment ===

The best way to manage asthma is to avoid any known triggers and use medications to keep your airways open. Your provider might prescribe:

  - Maintenance inhalers : These usually contain inhaled steroids that reduce inflammation. Sometimes, they’re combined with different types of bronchodilators (medicines that open your airways).
  - A rescue inhaler : Fast-acting “rescue” inhalers can help during an asthma attack. They contain a bronchodilator that quickly opens your airways, like albuterol .
  - A nebulizer : Nebulizers spray a fine mist of medication through a mask on your face. You might use a nebulizer instead of an inhaler for some medications.
  - Leukotriene modifiers : Your provider might prescribe a daily pill to help reduce asthma symptoms and your risk of an asthma attack.
  - Oral steroids : Your provider might prescribe a short course of oral steroids for a flare-up.
  - Antihistamines : Your provider might recommend cetirizine (Zyrtec ® ), loratadine (Claritin ® ), fexofenadine (Allegra ® ) or other allergy medications if you have allergic asthma.
  - Biologic therapy : Treatments like monoclonal antibodies might help severe asthma.
  - Bronchial thermoplasty : If other treatments don’t work, your provider may suggest bronchial thermoplasty. In this procedure, a pulmonologist uses heat to thin the muscles around your airways.


** Asthma action plan **


Your healthcare provider will work with you to develop an asthma action plan . This plan tells you how and when to use your medicines. It also tells you what to do when you have certain symptoms and when to seek emergency care. Ask your healthcare provider to walk you through it.

Talk to your healthcare provider if you’re having frequent asthma attacks or feel like your symptoms aren’t manageable. Make sure you understand your asthma action plan and when to go to the emergency room.

Use your rescue inhaler, then call 911 (or your local emergency number) if you’re having a severe asthma attack or are experiencing these symptoms:

  - Anxiety or panic
  - Bluish, whitish or grayish fingernails, lips or gums
  - Chest pain or pressure
  - Coughing that won’t stop
  - Severe wheezing when you breathe
  - Difficulty talking or swallowing
  - Pale , sweaty face
  - Rapid breathing
