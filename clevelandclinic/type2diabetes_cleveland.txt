=== Management and Treatment ===

The key parts of managing Type 2 diabetes include:

  - Lifestyle changes, like more exercise and eating adjustments
  - Medication
  - Glucose monitoring

You mainly manage T2D on your own with medical guidance and support from your healthcare team. This could include your:

  - Primary care physician (PCP) or endocrinologist
  - Registered dietitian
  - Certified diabetes care and education specialist (CDCES)
  - Eye doctor
  - Dentist

Your team should also include family members and other important people in your life. Managing T2D can be challenging — you must make several decisions every day for it. Loved ones can help carry this mental load.


** Physical activity **


Regular physical activity is helpful for managing T2D because it:

  - Lowers your blood sugar level in the short term and long term
  - Improves blood flow and blood pressure
  - Helps with stress management
  - May help with weight loss
  - Increases your energy level and boosts your mood

Talk to your provider before starting an exercise program. You may need to take special steps before, during and after physical activity. Especially if you take insulin. The general goal is to get at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity physical activity.


** Diet changes **


Together, you and your healthcare provider or a dietitian will form a meal plan that works for you. What and when you eat impact your blood sugar.

Most providers recommend eating a variety of nutritious foods. In general, the following types of foods can help support healthy glucose levels:

  - Lean proteins
  - Non-starchy vegetables
  - Sources of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats
  - Complex carbohydrates


** Medications **


Your provider may recommend taking medication for Type 2 diabetes. These include:

  - Oral diabetes medications : You take these by mouth to help manage blood sugar. There are several types that work in different ways. The most common one is metformin. Your provider may prescribe more than one medication at a time.
  - GLP-1 and dual GLP-1/GIP agonists : These are injectable medications. Some GLP-1 agonists can also help treat obesity.
  - Insulin : Synthetic insulin directly lowers blood sugar levels. There are several types of insulin. You may inject it with syringes or pens or use an insulin pump.
  - Other medicines : You may take other medicines to treat coexisting conditions, like high blood pressure and high cholesterol.


** Glucose monitoring **


Monitoring your glucose helps you know how well your current treatment plan is working. It can help you make decisions about food, physical activity and medication needs.

Several things can affect your blood sugar. You can learn to predict some of these impacts with time and practice. But others are very difficult or impossible to predict. That’s why it’s important to check your glucose regularly if your healthcare provider recommends doing so. Your provider will also give you a goal glucose range.

The two main ways you can monitor your glucose at home are with a glucose meter and/or a continuous glucose monitor (CGM).


** Can Type 2 diabetes be reversed? **


Type 2 diabetes is a chronic (long-term) disease. This means you must manage it for the rest of your life. There’s no cure for T2D. But you can manage it in a way that keeps your blood sugar levels in a healthy range. If you stop managing it or undermanage it, your blood sugar levels will go back up.

You’ll need regular appointments with your healthcare team to be sure you’re on track with your T2D management plan. As your body, life and routines change, your management will change, as well. Your healthcare team can provide new strategies tailored to your needs.

If you develop symptoms of any complications, see your provider as soon as possible.
