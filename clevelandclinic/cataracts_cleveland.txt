=== Management and Treatment ===

Cataract surgery is the only way to remove cataracts and restore your clear vision. During cataract surgery, an ophthalmologist removes your clouded natural lens and replaces it with an intraocular lens (IOL). An IOL is an artificial lens that permanently stays in your eye. There are many different options for IOLs that your provider can discuss with you.

The main benefit of an IOL is that it’s clear — like your natural lens should be. Another benefit is that it can correct refractive errors , allowing you to rely less on glasses or contact lenses after your surgery.


** Is cataract surgery safe? **


Cataract surgery is one of the safest and most commonly performed surgeries in the U.S. Most people have no serious complications. But it’s important to be aware of all possible risks, including retinal detachment and infection.

Certain eye diseases or underlying medical conditions can raise your risk of complications. So, you should talk to your provider about your individual level of risk prior to your surgery. Also, ask how they can treat any potential problems that may occur.


** Recovery from cataract surgery **


You may have mild pain and discomfort after your surgery. Your provider can give you a pain reliever to use for the first day or two.

Full recovery takes four to eight weeks. But you should notice improvements in your vision much sooner. Your provider will tell you when it’s safe to return to your usual activities.
