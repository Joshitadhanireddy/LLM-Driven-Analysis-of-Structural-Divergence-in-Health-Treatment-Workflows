=== Management and Treatment ===


--- How is acromegaly treated? ---


There are several treatment options for acromegaly. Your healthcare provider will consider your symptoms and circumstances before offering treatment options that are right for you.

The most common treatments for acromegaly are surgery, medication and radiation therapy .


** Surgery for acromegaly **


In many cases, surgery greatly improves acromegaly symptoms or corrects the condition entirely. Surgeons most often use a type of surgery called transsphenoidal surgery, which involves going through your nose and sphenoid sinus, a hollow space in your skull behind the nasal passages and below your brain, to perform surgery.

The specifics of the surgery will depend on the size and location of the tumor. The goal of surgery is to remove all of a tumor that is causing excess growth hormone production. If your surgeon removes enough of the tumor, you may not need further treatment. If your surgeon can remove only a part of a tumor, you may need medication or radiation therapy to manage your symptoms and reduce the production of growth hormone.


** Medications for acromegaly **


Your healthcare provider may prescribe one medication or a combination of medications. Medications work in different ways to normalize your body’s growth hormone levels and improve your symptoms. In some cases, a person may take medication until the tumor has shrunk. This can allow a surgeon to then safely remove it. Other people may need to take medication long-term to effectively manage growth hormone levels and symptoms.


--- Is acromegaly curable? ---


Acromegaly is curable in some situations but not all. The cure rate for surgical removal of a pituitary tumor that’s causing acromegaly is about 85% for small tumors and 40% to 50% percent for large tumors.

Medication can’t cure acromegaly but offers long-term, safe treatment.
