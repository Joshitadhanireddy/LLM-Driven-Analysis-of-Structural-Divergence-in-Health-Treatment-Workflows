=== Management and Treatment ===


--- How is progeria treated? ---


There’s currently no cure for progeria, but researchers are studying several drugs to treat the condition. Progeria treatment includes the use of a drug called lonafarnib (Zokinvy™). Originally developed to treat cancer, lonafarnib has been shown to improve many aspects of progeria. The drug has increased the average survival rate of children with the disease by two-and-a-half years. Every child on the drug has shown improvement in one or more of four areas:

  - Increased flexibility of blood vessels .
  - Improved bone structure.
  - Weight gain.
  - Improved hearing .

Physical therapy may help your child achieve a good range of motion, balance and posture. In addition, it can help reduce pain in their hips and feet. Occupational therapy can help your child develop in areas such as eating, personal hygiene and handwriting.

Your child may benefit greatly from care to help them live as healthy and comfortable a life as possible. Your child’s healthcare provider will monitor and manage their condition through:

  - Monitoring for heart disease: Your child’s provider will check their blood pressure and perform regular tests such as echocardiograms . Low-dose aspirin therapy and statin drugs can help reduce some risks of heart disease.
  - Imaging studies (such as magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI ): Your child’s provider will use imaging tests to watch for strokes or to check on headaches or seizures , both of which can be common.
  - Regular eye exams: Your child may have eye problems, including farsightedness or dry eyes . Dry eyes can occur because your child’s eyelids may not close completely. As the condition advances, your child may also develop cataracts. They may have thinner or absent eyebrows and eyelashes, which can make it more likely that irritants can get in their eyes. Also, your child may have a strong sensitivity to light and may want to wear sunglasses in some settings.
  - Hearing tests: Your child may have hearing loss that can be improved with hearing aids .
  - Regular dental exams: Your child is more likely to have dental problems such as cavities , severe crowding, delayed arrival of teeth and recessed gums. Regular dental appointments can help monitor and treat any dental issues.
  - Monitoring for skin problems: Your child’s provider will monitor for dark spots or bulges on your child’s skin . They’ll also look for hair loss, itching and skin tightness that restricts motion and can make it difficult to breathe or digest food.
  - Monitoring of bone health: Your child may have several issues related to bone growth and development, as well as joint problems.
