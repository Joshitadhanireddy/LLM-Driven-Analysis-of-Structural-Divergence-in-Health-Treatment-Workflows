=== Management and Treatment ===


--- How is presbycusis treated? ---


The most common presbycusis treatment is to use hearing aids . Hearing aids amplify sounds and deliver them to your ear. But hearing aids can’t cure presbycusis or restore lost hearing.

The treatment is the same for all types of presbycusis.


--- When should I see my healthcare provider? ---


Your primary care provider may recommend you see an audiologist. Once you’re diagnosed, you’ll probably need annual checkups with your audiologist. During these visits, they can do hearing tests to see if your hearing loss is getting worse. Contact your audiologist if you notice you’re having issues hearing even when you wear your hearing aids.
