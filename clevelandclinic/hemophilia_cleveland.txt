=== Management and Treatment ===

Your treatment will depend on your situation. For example, people with severe forms of hemophilia A or hemophilia B may have replacement therapy. You receive human plasma concentrates or lab-made clotting factors. These boost your clotting factor levels. Replacement therapy may prevent bleeding or slow it down.

Newer treatments are:

  - Marstacimab-hncq (Hympavzi ® ) : This is an alternative preventive therapy for people with severe hemophilia A and B. It works by blocking a protein that keeps your blood from clotting. It also boosts an enzyme that helps your blood clot. Concizumab (Alhemo ® ) is a similar medication.
  - Fitusiran (Qfitlia®) : This medication keeps your liver from making antithrombin, a substance that keeps your blood from clotting .
  - Gene therapy : This treatment involves the changed gene that causes low levels of clotting factors. It replaces the changed gene with one that instructs your body to make more clotting factors.

Your provider may tell you to avoid pain medications — like aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen — which keep your blood from clotting. You should also avoid anticoagulants such as heparin or warfarin.

Contact your healthcare provider if you notice changes in your body, like increased bleeding or bruising. If you have hemophilia, go to the emergency room right away if you:

  - Have severe headaches or double vision, as these symptoms could mean you have bleeding in your brain
  - Have severe joint swelling and joint pain, which can happen if you use replacement therapy and don’t have access to your medication
