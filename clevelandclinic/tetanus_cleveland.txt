=== Management and Treatment ===


--- How is tetanus treated? ---


If your healthcare provider suspects you have tetanus, they’ll start treating it immediately. That treatment involves the following:

  - Wound care . Cleaning (debriding) your wound can remove some of the bacteria, stopping them from releasing more toxins. This can shorten how long the effects of tetanus last.
  - Medications . Tetanus antitoxin will block additional toxin from taking effect. Antibiotics like metronidazole may help get rid of remaining bacteria. You’ll also likely receive muscle relaxers , benzodiazepines or other drugs to treat tetanus symptoms.
  - Rest . Light and sound can trigger tetanus muscle spasms. Your provider will likely recommend you rest in a dim, quiet room to limit spasms.
  - Breathing support . Keeping your airway open is a top priority. If you need breathing tube placement and mechanical ventilation , you’ll likely receive sedation to help keep you comfortable.

** Recovery time **


Once tetanus symptoms develop, it can take two to three weeks for the disease to run its course. But it can take months to recover from tetanus. Your healthcare provider can tell you more about what’s likely to happen in your specific case.
