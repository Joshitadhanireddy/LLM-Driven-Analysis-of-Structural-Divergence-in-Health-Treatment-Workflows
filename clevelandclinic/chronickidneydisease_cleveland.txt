=== Management and Treatment ===


--- How is chronic kidney disease treated? ---


There’s no cure for chronic kidney disease (CKD), but steps can be taken to preserve your kidney function so they work as long as possible. If you have reduced kidney function:

  - Make and keep your regular healthcare provider/ nephrologist (kidney specialist) visits. These providers monitor your kidney health.
  - Manage your blood glucose (sugar) if you have diabetes.
  - Avoid taking painkillers and other medications that may make your kidney disease worse.
  - Manage your blood pressure levels.
  - Follow a kidney-friendly diet. Dietary changes may include limiting protein, eating foods that reduce blood cholesterol levels and limiting sodium (salt) and potassium intake.
  - Don’t smoke .
  - Exercise/be active on most days of the week.
  - Stay at a weight that’s healthy for you.


** Medications for kidney disease **


Depending on the cause of your kidney disease, you may be prescribed one or more medications. Medications your nephrologist may prescribe include:

  - An angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) to lower your blood pressure.
  - Phosphate binder if your kidneys can’t eliminate phosphate.
  - A diuretic to help your body eliminate extra fluid.
  - Medications to lower cholesterol levels.
  - Erythropoietin to build red blood cells if you’re anemic.
  - Vitamin D and calcitriol to prevent bone loss.


** What is kidney dialysis? **


Because there’s no cure for CKD, if you’re in end-stage kidney disease, you and your healthcare team must consider additional options. Complete kidney failure will result in death if it’s left untreated. Options for end-stage kidney disease include dialysis and kidney transplantation.

Dialysis is a procedure that uses machines to remove waste products from your body when your kidneys are no longer able to perform this function. There are two major types of dialysis:

  - Hemodialysis: With hemodialysis, your blood is circulated through a machine that removes waste products, excess water and excess salt. The blood is then returned to your body. Hemodialysis requires four-hour treatments, three times a week.
  - Peritoneal dialysis: In peritoneal dialysis, a dialysis solution is placed directly into your abdomen through a catheter. The solution absorbs waste and then is removed via the same catheter. Fresh solution is added to continue the process of cleaning. You can perform this type of dialysis yourself. There are two types of peritoneal dialysis: continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), which involves a change in dialysis solution four times a day; and continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD). CCPD uses a machine to automatically fill, remove and refill the fluid during the nighttime.


** What is a kidney transplant? **


Kidney transplantation involves replacing an unhealthy kidney with a healthy kidney. Kidneys for transplantation come from two sources: living donors and deceased donors. Living donors are usually family members, partners or friends. A living kidney donor is possible because a person can live well with one healthy kidney.

Deceased donor kidneys usually come from people who are organ donors. All donors are carefully screened to make sure there’s a suitable match and to prevent any transmissible diseases or other complications.

On average, people wait about three to five years for a kidney from a deceased donor. It’s usually quicker to receive a kidney from a living donor.
