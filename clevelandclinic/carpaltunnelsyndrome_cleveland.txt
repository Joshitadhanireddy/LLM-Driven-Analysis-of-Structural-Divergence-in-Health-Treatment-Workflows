=== Management and Treatment ===


--- What are carpal tunnel syndrome treatments? ---


Providers treat carpal tunnel syndrome with nonsurgical (conservative) treatments first. You may need carpal tunnel surgery if conservative treatments don’t relieve your symptoms.


** Nonsurgical carpal tunnel treatments **


The most common carpal tunnel treatments include modifying your daily routine, supporting and strengthening your wrist and taking medication:

  - Wearing a splint (especially at night): A splint will hold your wrist in a neutral position to take pressure off your median nerve.
  - Physical therapy: A physical therapist can help you strengthen muscles around your wrist and increase your flexibility.
  - Changing your posture or working environment: An occupational therapist can suggest ways to modify how you do everyday tasks to move safely and more comfortably. You might need to change how you sit or stand, how you position your keyboard or make other posture tweaks.
  - Over-the-counter medications: Your provider might suggest over-the-counter NSAIDs or acetaminophen to reduce inflammation and relieve pain. Don’t take these medicines for more than 10 days in a row without talking to your provider.
  - Corticosteroids : Corticosteroids are prescription anti-inflammatory medications. Your provider may give you cortisone shots in your affected carpal tunnel.

** Carpal tunnel syndrome surgery **


If conservative treatments don’t work, your provider will suggest carpal tunnel surgery. Your surgeon will perform a carpal tunnel release to create more space inside your wrist. They’ll make an incision (cut) in the ligament that connects your wrist to your palm (your transverse carpal ligament). This reduces tension on your carpal tunnel and gives your tendons and nerves more space.

Carpal tunnel release surgery is usually an outpatient procedure, which means you can go home the same day. Your surgeon will tell you what the expect and will give you recovery instructions.


--- How soon after treatment will I feel better? ---


You should start feeling better as soon as you start carpal tunnel treatment. It might take a few weeks (or longer) for nonsurgical treatments to reduce the pressure on your median nerve, but your symptoms should start improving gradually.

Carpal tunnel surgery should improve your symptoms as soon as your wrist heals. It usually takes a month or two to recover.
