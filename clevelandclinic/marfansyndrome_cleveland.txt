=== Management and Treatment ===

There’s no cure for Marfan syndrome. But various treatments and strategies can help manage your symptoms and prevent complications, like:

  - Medications
  - Routine monitoring
  - Physical activity guidance
  - Surgery

You’ll need a treatment plan that’s specific to your health issues.


** Medications **


Certain medications can help prevent or manage complications, including:

  - Beta-blockers . Beta-blockers prevent or slow down the enlargement of your aorta. Healthcare providers recommend beta-blocker therapy at an early age for MFS. If you can’t take them because of asthma or side effects, your provider can prescribe a calcium channel blocker .
  - Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) . ARBs may also slow the rate of aorta enlargement in people with MFS.

If you get heart valve surgery for MFS, you’ll need to be on an anticoagulant medication for the rest of your life.


** Monitoring **


You’ll need routine medical appointments to monitor your:

  - Heart and blood vessels — in particular, the size of your aorta
  - Eyes
  - Skeletal system

This way, your healthcare team can track changes and catch any possible complications as soon as they appear. Your team will tell you how often you need these appointments.

Monitoring for MFS usually involves imaging tests, like:

  - CT scans
  - Echocardiograms
  - MRI scans


** Physical activity guidance **


Intense physical activity can strain your aorta and other connective tissues impacted by MFS. Because of this, you’ll work closely with a physical therapist to find exercises and sports that are safe for you.

Providers generally recommend low- to moderate-intensity exercise for most people with MFS. But you may need less if you have aortic root or valve replacement.

In general, you’ll likely need to avoid:

  - Activities involving the Valsalva maneuver
  - Contact sports
  - Exercise to exhaustion
  - Isometric exercises , like planks and wall sits


** Heart surgery **


The goal of heart surgery for Marfan syndrome is to prevent your aorta from dissecting or rupturing and to treat valve problems. Together, you and your healthcare team will decide if surgery is right for you based on several factors.

The most common surgeries and procedures for MFS include:

  - Aortic valve repair or replacement
  - Ascending aortic aneurysm repair
  - Mitral valve repair or replacement
  - Thoracic endovascular aortic repair

If you need surgery, you should aim to choose a major health system that’s experienced in the type of surgery you’re getting. Your surgical team should be familiar with Marfan syndrome, as well.
