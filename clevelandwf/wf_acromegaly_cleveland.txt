ACROMEGALY TREATMENT WORKFLOW (from Cleveland Clinic-based plan)

1. Treatment planning
   - Confirm diagnosis and pituitary tumor characteristics.
   - Discuss surgery, medications and/or radiation based on tumor size, location, age, comorbidities and symptom severity.

2. First-line: Pituitary tumor surgery
   - Transsphenoidal surgery through nose and sphenoid sinus.
   - Goal: remove all GH-secreting tumor tissue.
   - If only partial removal is possible → plan adjuvant medical and/or radiation therapy.

3. Medical therapy
   - Use when:
     * Surgery is not possible or declined.
     * Residual tumor or persistent hormone excess after surgery.
     * Pre-op to shrink tumor and make surgery safer in selected cases.
   - Options (chosen individually):
     * Somatostatin analogs.
     * GH receptor antagonists.
     * Dopamine agonists.
   - Aim: normalize GH/IGF-1 and improve symptoms; may be long-term in non-curable disease.

4. Radiation therapy
   - For residual or recurrent tumor and persistent GH excess despite surgery/medication.
   - Effect on hormone levels is delayed; use along with ongoing medical therapy as needed.

5. Long-term follow-up
   - Serial GH/IGF-1 levels and pituitary imaging.
   - Ongoing assessment for symptom control and treatment side effects.
   - Manage comorbidities such as diabetes, sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease.
