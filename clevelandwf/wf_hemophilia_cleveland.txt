HEMOPHILIA TREATMENT WORKFLOW (from Cleveland Clinic-based plan)

1. Core therapy: replace missing clotting factor
   - Use human plasma–derived or lab-made (recombinant) factor concentrates.
   - Give replacement therapy to prevent bleeding (prophylaxis) or to control active bleeds.

2. Newer/advanced treatments
   - Preventive agents that rebalance clotting pathways (e.g., monoclonal antibodies and RNA-based therapies).
   - Gene therapy approaches that aim to restore endogenous production of the missing factor.

3. Medication precautions
   - Avoid medicines that increase bleeding risk (aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen and anticoagulants) unless explicitly directed by a specialist.

4. Monitoring and emergency care
   - Educate patients to seek urgent evaluation for severe headache, double vision, or rapidly increasing joint swelling/pain.
   - Maintain close follow-up with a comprehensive hemophilia treatment center when possible.
