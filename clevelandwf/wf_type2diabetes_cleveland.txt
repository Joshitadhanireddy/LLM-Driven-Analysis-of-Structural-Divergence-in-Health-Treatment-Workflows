TYPE 2 DIABETES MANAGEMENT WORKFLOW (from Cleveland Clinic-based plan)

1. Core components and care team
   - Lifestyle changes (diet, physical activity, weight management).
   - Glucose-lowering medications and regular glucose monitoring.
   - Ongoing guidance from a multidisciplinary team: PCP/endocrinologist, dietitian, diabetes educator, eye doctor, dentist and family/support system.

2. Physical activity
   - Aim for at least 150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity activity, spaced over most days.
   - Discuss exercise plan with provider, especially if using insulin or at high cardiovascular risk.
   - Learn special precautions before, during and after exercise to prevent hypoglycemia and other complications.

3. Nutrition and meal planning
   - Develop an individualized meal plan with provider/dietitian.
   - Emphasize:
     * Lean proteins.
     * Non-starchy vegetables.
     * Healthy fats (mono- and polyunsaturated).
     * Complex carbohydrates.
   - Coordinate meal timing and carbohydrate intake with medication and activity.

4. Glucose-lowering medications
   - Oral agents:
     * Metformin is most common first-line drug; others added based on need.
   - Injectable agents:
     * GLP-1 or dual GLP-1/GIP agonists (many also help with weight loss).
     * Insulin (various types) via pens/syringes or insulin pump when oral/injectable non‑insulin meds are insufficient.
   - Additional medicines to treat associated conditions such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia.

5. Glucose monitoring
   - Use finger-stick glucose meter and/or continuous glucose monitor (CGM).
   - Check at frequency recommended by provider; know personal target range.
   - Use results to adjust food intake, activity and medication (with clinical guidance).

6. Long-term management
   - Regular follow-up visits to reassess A1c, complications, lifestyle and treatment plan.
   - Adjust therapy as life circumstances and health status change.
   - Education on recognizing and responding to hypo- and hyperglycemia and on seeking prompt care for complications.
