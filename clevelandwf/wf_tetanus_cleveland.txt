TETANUS TREATMENT WORKFLOW (from Cleveland Clinic-based plan)

1. Immediate management (start on clinical suspicion)
   - Do not wait for confirmatory tests.
   - Admit for close monitoring, often in an intensive care setting.

2. Wound care
   - Clean and debride the wound thoroughly.
   - Remove devitalized tissue to reduce bacterial load and toxin production.

3. Medications
   - Tetanus antitoxin to neutralize circulating toxin and prevent further effect.
   - Antibiotics, typically metronidazole, to eradicate remaining Clostridium tetani.
   - Muscle relaxants, benzodiazepines and other agents to control spasms and autonomic symptoms.

4. Environmental control and rest
   - Place patient in dim, quiet room.
   - Avoid stimuli (light, sound, touch) that can trigger spasms.

5. Airway and respiratory support
   - Monitor airway closely.
   - Intubation and mechanical ventilation if breathing is compromised or to protect airway during severe spasms.

6. Recovery
   - Explain that illness may take weeks to run its course and months for full recovery.
   - Plan rehabilitation after acute phase to restore strength and function.
