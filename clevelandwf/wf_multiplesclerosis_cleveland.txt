MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS) TREATMENT WORKFLOW (from Cleveland Clinic-based plan)

1. Treatment objectives
   - Limit new demyelinating damage.
   - Reduce relapse frequency and severity.
   - Control symptoms and maintain function and quality of life.

2. Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs)
   - Long-term DMTs to reduce relapses and new MRI lesions and slow progression.
   - Options include injectables, oral agents and IV infusions selected by MS specialists based on disease type and severity.

3. Management of acute relapses
   - High-dose corticosteroids (e.g., IV methylprednisolone) for significant attacks.
   - Plasma exchange or IV immunoglobulin in select severe, steroid-refractory attacks.

4. Symptom management
   - Therapies tailored to vision problems, pain, spasticity, bladder/bowel dysfunction, mobility issues, fatigue and cognitive or mood changes.
   - Use assistive devices (cane, walker, wheelchair) as needed for safe mobility.

5. Rehabilitation and mental health
   - Physical, occupational and speech therapy.
   - Mental health counseling and support groups to address emotional impact.

6. Ongoing care
   - Regular neurologic follow-up, MRI monitoring and DMT adjustments.
   - Discuss clinical trial participation when appropriate.
