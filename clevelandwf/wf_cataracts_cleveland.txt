CATARACTS TREATMENT WORKFLOW (from Cleveland Clinic-based plan)

1. Non-surgical optimization
   - Update glasses/contact lens prescription.
   - Use brighter or task-specific lighting and magnifiers if needed.
   - Monitor vision regularly.

2. Indications for cataract surgery
   - Blurred or hazy vision affecting daily activities (reading, driving, work).
   - Glare, halos or difficulty with night driving.
   - Need for clearer view of retina to manage other eye diseases.

3. Cataract surgery
   - Outpatient phacoemulsification with removal of cloudy lens.
   - Implantation of an intraocular lens (IOL) selected for refractive goals.
   - Discuss IOL options (monofocal, multifocal, toric, etc.) before surgery.

4. Post-operative care and recovery
   - Short course of eye drops for infection and inflammation.
   - Mild discomfort for a day or two; vision improves over days to weeks.
   - Full recovery usually in 4–8 weeks, with final glasses prescription if needed.
