CHLAMYDIA TREATMENT WORKFLOW (from Cleveland Clinic-based plan)

1. Core antibiotic treatment
   - Treat with recommended antibiotics (e.g., doxycycline 7 days or azithromycin single dose per guidelines).
   - Emphasize completing the full course even if symptoms resolve early.

2. Sexual activity precautions
   - Abstain from all sexual contact until treatment is completed and symptoms have cleared.
   - Use barrier protection consistently after treatment to reduce reinfection risk.

   - Notify and encourage testing/treatment of all sexual partners from the prior 3 months.
   - Offer STI screening for other infections (HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, etc.).

4. Follow-up
   - Arrange follow-up testing as advised to ensure eradication, especially in pregnancy or recurrent infection.
   - Counsel on regular STI screening for sexually active individuals at risk.
