HEARING LOSS (AGE-RELATED / PRESBYCUSIS) TREATMENT WORKFLOW (from Cleveland Clinic-based plan)

1. Evaluation and diagnosis
   - Clinical assessment and audiologic testing.
   - Classify type and degree of hearing loss.

2. Primary treatment
   - Hearing aids:
     * Fit and program devices to amplify sounds and improve communication.
     * Educate on use, care and realistic expectations (improvement, not cure).

3. Ongoing monitoring
   - Regular follow-up with audiologist (often yearly) for hearing tests and device adjustment.
   - Reassess if hearing worsens or aids seem less effective.

4. Additional support
   - Communication strategies (face-to-face conversation, reducing background noise).
   - Consider assistive listening devices and referral for auditory rehabilitation as needed.
