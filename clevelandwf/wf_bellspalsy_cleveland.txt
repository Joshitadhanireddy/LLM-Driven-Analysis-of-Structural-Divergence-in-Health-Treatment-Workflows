BELL’S PALSY MANAGEMENT WORKFLOW (from Cleveland Clinic-based plan)

1. Eye protection (priority)
   - Use artificial tears/eye drops throughout the day for dryness.
   - Use ointment and/or an eye patch if eyelid does not fully close to protect cornea from injury and dryness.

2. Early medical therapy
   - Oral corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone) started within 48 hours of symptom onset to reduce nerve swelling and speed recovery.
   - Antiviral medications may be added in severe cases; benefit is modest and greatest when combined with steroids early.

3. Adjunctive care
   - Pain control with standard analgesics if needed.
   - Reassurance: most people improve and many recover fully over weeks to months.

4. Non-routine therapies
   - Electrical stimulation is not recommended as studies have not shown clear benefit in preventing muscle loss.

5. Persistent deficit
   - If facial weakness or asymmetry does not resolve, consider functional facial plastic surgery procedures to improve eyelid closure or facial symmetry.
