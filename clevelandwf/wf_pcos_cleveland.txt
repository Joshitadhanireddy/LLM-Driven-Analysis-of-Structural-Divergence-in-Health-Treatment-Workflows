POLYCYSTIC OVARY SYNDROME (PCOS) TREATMENT WORKFLOW (from Cleveland Clinic-based plan)

1. Determine pregnancy intention
   - Tailor treatment based on whether pregnancy is currently desired, may be desired in future, or not planned.

2. If pregnancy is NOT currently desired
   2.1 Hormonal birth control
       - Pills, patch, shot, ring or hormonal IUD.
       - Regulate menstrual cycles; some methods improve acne and excess hair growth.
   2.2 Insulin-sensitizing therapy
       - Metformin to improve insulin handling and help normalize cycles.
   2.3 Anti-androgen therapy
       - Medications that block androgen effects to reduce acne and hirsutism.
   2.4 Lifestyle changes
       - Nutritious diet and weight management to improve insulin levels and metabolic health.

3. If pregnancy IS desired now or in the future
   3.1 Ovulation induction
       - Oral drugs such as clomiphene or letrozole to stimulate ovulation.
       - Injectable gonadotropins when oral agents are ineffective or not appropriate.
   3.2 Surgical options (rarely used now)
       - Ovarian drilling to destroy androgen-producing tissue when medication fails.
   3.3 Assisted reproductive technology
       - In vitro fertilization (IVF) if ovulation induction alone is insufficient.

4. Long-term outlook and counseling
   - PCOS has no permanent cure, but symptoms and risks can be managed effectively.
   - Symptoms may lessen around menopause, but treatment should address quality of life at any age.
   - Discuss pregnancy risks and strategies to support healthy conception and pregnancy.
