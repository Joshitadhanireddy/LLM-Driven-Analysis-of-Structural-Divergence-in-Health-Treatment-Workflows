GERD / HEARTBURN TREATMENT WORKFLOW (from Cleveland Clinic-based plan)

1. Initial home and OTC management (occasional heartburn)
   - Lifestyle adjustments (avoid big late meals, trigger foods, lying flat after eating).
   - Over-the-counter (OTC) medications as needed.

2. Medication options
   2.1 Antacids
       - Neutralize stomach acid and give quick symptom relief.
       - Often combined with agents for gas or constipation.
   2.2 Alginates
       - Form a floating barrier above stomach contents to block reflux.
       - Available alone or combined with antacids.
   2.3 H2 blockers
       - Reduce acid production by blocking histamine signaling.
       - Available OTC and by prescription; may lose effect with long-term use.
   2.4 Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)
       - Strongest acid-suppressing drugs; first-line for more severe or frequent symptoms or esophageal damage.
       - Promote healing of esophagitis and ulcers; ~90% effective at reducing acid reflux.

3. Additional medical therapies (selected cases)
   - Antibiotics or antivirals when infection is contributing.
   - Topical steroids or dupilumab for inflammatory esophagitis.
   - Low-dose neuromodulators or complementary therapies for functional heartburn.
   - Hernia repair surgery if hiatal hernia is a major driver of reflux.

4. Procedural options for refractory GERD or to avoid long-term PPIs
   - Nissen fundoplication (laparoscopic tightening of the gastroesophageal junction).
   - Transoral incisionless fundoplication (endoscopic version).
   - LINX device: magnetic ring implant at lower esophageal sphincter to prevent reflux.

5. Ongoing care
   - Reassess symptoms and PPI need periodically.
   - Evaluate for complications (esophagitis, strictures, Barrett esophagus) when indicated.
