CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME TREATMENT WORKFLOW (from Cleveland Clinic-based plan)

1. Initial conservative management
   - Wear a neutral-position wrist splint, especially at night.
   - Modify daily activities and ergonomics to reduce repetitive wrist flexion/extension.
   - Use OTC pain relievers (acetaminophen or NSAIDs) short-term as advised.
   - Begin physical/occupational therapy for stretching, strengthening and posture adjustment.

2. Escalation of nonsurgical care
   - If symptoms persist, consider corticosteroid injection into the carpal tunnel.
   - Reassess contributing conditions (diabetes, thyroid disease, inflammatory arthritis).

3. Surgical management
   - Indications: moderate–severe symptoms, muscle weakness/atrophy, or failure of conservative therapy.
   - Carpal tunnel release:
     * Open or endoscopic division of the transverse carpal ligament.
     * Outpatient procedure with structured post-op rehab.

4. Recovery and follow-up
   - Gradual return of strength and sensation over weeks to months.
   - Ongoing ergonomic and activity modifications to reduce recurrence.
