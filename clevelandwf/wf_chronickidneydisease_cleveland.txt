CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE (CKD) TREATMENT WORKFLOW (from Cleveland Clinic-based plan)

1. Slow progression and protect kidneys
   - Maintain regular visits with primary provider/nephrologist.
   - Tight control of diabetes (if present) and blood pressure.
   - Avoid nephrotoxic medications (unnecessary NSAIDs and other harmful drugs).

2. Lifestyle and diet
   - Follow a kidney-friendly diet:
     * Adjust protein intake.
     * Limit sodium, potassium and phosphorus as advised.
     * Choose heart-healthy, cholesterol-lowering foods.
   - Don’t smoke; maintain healthy weight; exercise most days of the week.

3. Medication management
   - ACE inhibitor or ARB for blood pressure and kidney protection when indicated.
   - Diuretics for fluid overload.
   - Phosphate binders, vitamin D and calcitriol for mineral/bone health.
   - Erythropoietin and iron for anemia.
   - Lipid-lowering medications for cardiovascular protection.

4. Planning for advanced CKD
   - Educate about end-stage options: hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and kidney transplantation.
   - Refer early for transplant evaluation where appropriate.
