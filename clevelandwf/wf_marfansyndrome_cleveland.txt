MARFAN SYNDROME MANAGEMENT WORKFLOW (from Cleveland Clinic-based plan)

1. Overall management goals
   - Reduce risk of aortic enlargement, dissection and rupture.
   - Monitor and treat eye, skeletal and other organ involvement.

2. Medications
   - Beta-blockers to slow aortic root enlargement.
   - ARBs or calcium channel blockers when beta-blockers aren’t tolerated or as additional therapy.
   - Lifelong anticoagulation if mechanical valve replacement is performed.

3. Routine monitoring
   - Regular imaging (echo, CT or MRI) of aorta and heart valves.
   - Scheduled eye examinations and skeletal assessments.

4. Physical activity guidelines
   - Favor low- to moderate-intensity activities.
   - Avoid high-impact contact sports, heavy isometric exertion, or exercise to exhaustion.

5. Surgical management
   - Elective surgery for aortic root aneurysm or significant valve disease to prevent dissection/rupture.
   - Care at centers experienced in Marfan-related cardiovascular surgery.
