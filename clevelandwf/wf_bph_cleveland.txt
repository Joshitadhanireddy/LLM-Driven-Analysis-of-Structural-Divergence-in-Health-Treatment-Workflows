BENIGN PROSTATIC HYPERPLASIA (BPH) TREATMENT WORKFLOW (from Cleveland Clinic-based plan)

1. Watchful waiting
   - Use if symptoms are mild and not very bothersome.
   - Schedule regular follow-up to monitor symptom progression.
   - Discuss lifestyle changes: reduce evening fluids, alcohol, caffeine; review meds that worsen flow.

2. Medication therapy
   2.1 Alpha-blockers
       - Relax prostate and bladder neck muscle to reduce urethral pressure.
       - Examples: tamsulosin, terazosin, doxazosin, alfuzosin, silodosin.
   2.2 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors
       - Decrease DHT production and slow prostate growth.
       - Most helpful in larger prostates.
       - Examples: finasteride, dutasteride.
   2.3 Combination therapy
       - Combine alpha-blocker + 5-ARI when monotherapy insufficient.
       - Example: dutasteride + tamsulosin in a single capsule.
   - Symptom improvement usually appears within 1–8 weeks of starting medication.

3. Surgical options
   - Indicated for persistent, bothersome symptoms or complications despite medication.
   - TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate) via resectoscope.
   - TUIP (transurethral incision of the prostate).
   - Transurethral electrovaporization.
   - GreenLight (PVP) laser vaporization.
   - Aquablation (water-jet ablation) for precisely removing tissue.

4. Minimally invasive treatments
   - Office-based procedures that are less invasive than surgery and often have faster recovery:
       * Prostatic urethral lift (UroLift) to mechanically separate lobes.
       * Rezūm water vapor thermal therapy to shrink tissue.
   - Typically outpatient with symptom improvement over several weeks.

5. Diet and lifestyle support
   - Encourage fruits, vegetables and healthy fats (Mediterranean-style pattern).
   - Limit processed foods, sugars, refined carbohydrates, alcohol, caffeine, dairy, red meat and excess sodium.
