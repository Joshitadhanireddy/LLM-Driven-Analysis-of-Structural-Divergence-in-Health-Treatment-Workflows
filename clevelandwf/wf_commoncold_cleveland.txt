COMMON COLD TREATMENT WORKFLOW (from Cleveland Clinic-based plan)

1. Core principles
   - Viral, self-limited illness; no cure, antibiotics not effective.
   - Typical duration: about 7–10 days.

2. Symptom relief with OTC medicines (adults, as appropriate)
   - Pain relievers (acetaminophen, NSAIDs) for headache, fever and body aches.
   - Decongestants for nasal congestion.
   - Antihistamines for sneezing and runny nose.
   - Cough suppressants and/or expectorants for troublesome cough.
   - Avoid duplicating ingredients across combination products.

3. Supportive measures
   - Rest and adequate fluids.
   - Humidifier or vaporizer; saline nasal drops/sprays.
   - For infants/young children: focus on comfort, fluids, and nasal saline plus gentle suction; avoid most OTC cough/cold meds unless prescribed.

4. When to seek medical care
   - High or persistent fever, breathing difficulty, chest pain.
   - Symptoms lasting longer than expected or worsening (possible complications like ear infection or pneumonia).
