ASTHMA MANAGEMENT WORKFLOW (from Cleveland Clinic-based plan)

1. Core strategy
   - Avoid known triggers.
   - Use controller medicines to keep airways open and reliever medicines for attacks.
   - Create a written asthma action plan with your provider.

2. Long-term control
   - Daily maintenance inhalers:
     * Inhaled corticosteroids, often combined with long-acting bronchodilators.
   - Leukotriene modifiers as add-on pills for symptom reduction and attack prevention.
   - Biologic therapies (monoclonal antibodies) for severe asthma not controlled on standard therapy.

3. Quick-relief treatment
   - Rescue inhaler with fast-acting bronchodilator (e.g., albuterol) for acute symptoms.
   - Nebulizer delivery when inhaler technique is difficult or higher doses are required.
   - Short course of oral steroids for significant flare-ups on provider’s advice.

4. Allergy-focused management
   - Oral antihistamines for allergic asthma.
   - Allergen avoidance and immunotherapy when appropriate.

5. Refractory severe asthma
   - Bronchial thermoplasty: bronchoscopic procedure using heat to thin airway smooth muscle layer in selected adults.

6. Asthma action plan & emergencies
   - Plan specifies daily medicines, how to step up during worsening symptoms and when to seek urgent/emergency care.
   - In a severe attack with signs such as persistent coughing, severe wheezing, chest pain, difficulty talking or bluish lips/fingernails → use rescue inhaler and call emergency services.
