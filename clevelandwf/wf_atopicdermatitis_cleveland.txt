ATOPIC DERMATITIS (ECZEMA) MANAGEMENT WORKFLOW (from Cleveland Clinic-based plan)

1. Trigger control and skin care
   - Identify and avoid personal triggers/allergens where possible.
   - Apply fragrance-free cream or ointment moisturizer at least twice daily.
   - Use gentle cleansers and avoid harsh soaps or hot water.

2. Topical prescription therapy
   - Use topical corticosteroids as directed for inflamed areas.
   - Use topical calcineurin inhibitors on sensitive areas or when steroid-sparing is needed.
   - Follow provider instructions carefully to avoid overuse and side effects.

3. Symptom relief and home measures
   - Over-the-counter hydrocortisone for mild itch if advised.
   - Oral antihistamines to reduce itch, especially at night.
   - Keep nails trimmed or wear gloves at night to limit scratching.
   - Wear loose, non-scratchy clothing; use a humidifier in dry environments.
   - Oatmeal baths (with colloidal oatmeal) to lock moisture into skin.

4. Advanced therapies
   - Allergen immunotherapy for patients with strong allergic components.
   - Phototherapy (light therapy) when topical therapy is inadequate or disease is widespread.

5. Monitoring and relapse management
   - Expect recurrent flares even with treatment; maintain daily skin-care routine.
   - Contact provider if lesions become painful, swollen or produce pus (possible infection) or if control is poor despite therapy.
