NARCOLEPSY TREATMENT WORKFLOW (from Cleveland Clinic-based plan)

1. Overall approach
   - Explain that narcolepsy is chronic but treatable.
   - Combine medications with lifestyle and safety strategies.

2. Medications
   - Wake-promoting drugs (e.g., modafinil/armodafinil) as first-line for daytime sleepiness.
   - Stimulants (methylphenidate, amphetamine combinations) when needed under close supervision.
   - Antidepressants (SSRIs, SNRIs, or tricyclics) to reduce cataplexy and REM-related phenomena.
   - Sodium oxybate at night to consolidate sleep and reduce cataplexy.
   - Histamine-targeting agents (e.g., pitolisant) as additional options.

3. Lifestyle and safety measures
   - Maintain regular sleep–wake schedule and plan short daytime naps.
   - Avoid alcohol and sedating medications without provider input.
   - Discuss driving, work and school accommodations to reduce accident risk.

4. Follow-up
   - Periodic review of symptom control, side effects and comorbid conditions.
   - Adjust therapy as needed and consider referral to sleep specialist and support resources.
