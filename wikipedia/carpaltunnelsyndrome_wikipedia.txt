--- Treatment ---


There are more than 50 types of treatments for CTS with varied levels of evidence and recommendations across healthcare guidelines, with evidence most strongly supporting surgery, steroids, splinting for wrist positioning, and physical or occupational therapy interventions.When selecting treatment, it is important to consider the severity and chronicity of the CTS pathophysiology and to distinguish treatments that can alter the natural history of the pathophysiology (disease-modifying treatments) and treatments that only alleviate symptoms (palliative treatments). The strongest evidence for disease-modifying treatment in chronic or severe CTS cases iscarpal tunnel surgeryto change the shape of the carpal tunnel.

The American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons recommends proceeding conservatively with a course of nonsurgical therapies tried before release surgery is considered.A different treatment should be tried if the current treatment fails to resolve the symptoms within 2 to 7 weeks. Early surgery with carpal tunnel release is indicated where there is evidence of median nerve denervation or a person elects to proceed directly to surgical treatment.Recommendations may differ when carpal tunnel syndrome is found in association with the following conditions:diabetes mellitus, coexistentcervical radiculopathy,hypothyroidism,polyneuropathy,pregnancy,rheumatoid arthritis, and carpal tunnel syndrome in the workplace.CTS related to another pathophysiology is addressed by treating that pathology. For instance, disease-modifying medications for rheumatoid arthritis or surgery for traumatic acute carpal tunnel syndrome.

There is insufficient evidence to recommendgabapentin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs),yoga,acupuncture,low level laser therapy, magnet therapy,vitamin B6or other supplements.


--- Splint immobilization ---


Wristbraces(splints) alleviate symptoms by keeping the wrist straight, which avoids the increased pressure in the carpal tunnel associated with wrist flexion or extension. They are used primarily to help people sleep.

Many health professionals suggest that for the best results, one should wear braces at night. When possible, braces can be worn during the activity, primarily causing stress on the wrists.The brace should not generally be used during the day as wrist activity is needed to keep the wrist from becoming stiff and to prevent muscles from weakening.


--- Corticosteroids ---


Corticosteroidinjections may provide temporary alleviation of symptoms, although they are not clearly better than a placebo.This form of treatment is thought to reduce discomfort in those with CTS due to its ability to decrease median nerve swelling.The use of ultrasound while performing the injection is more expensive but leads to faster resolution of CTS symptoms.The injections are done under local anesthesia.This treatment is not appropriate for extended periods, however. In general, local steroid injections are used until more definitive treatment options can be used. Corticosteroid injections do not appear to slow disease progression.


--- Surgery ---


Release of the transverse carpal ligament is undertaken incarpal tunnel surgery. The purpose of cutting the transverse carpal ligament is to relieve pressure on the median nerve, and this is a type ofnerve decompressionsurgery. It is recommended when there is constant (not just intermittent) numbness, muscle weakness, or atrophy, and when night-splinting or other palliative interventions no longer alleviate intermittent symptoms.The surgery may be done with localor regional anesthesiawithor withoutsedation, or under general anesthesia.In general, milder cases can be controlled without surgery for months to years, but severe cases are unrelenting symptomatically and are likely to result in surgical treatment.


--- Physical and occupational therapy ---


There are various techniques used in manual therapy for patients with CTS. Some examples include manual and instrumental soft tissue mobilizations, massage therapy, bone mobilizations or manipulations, and neurodynamic techniques, focused on the skeletal system or soft tissue.

In cases of epineural tethering in the upper extremity, manual therapy can reduce this dysfunction. It can have a positive impact on the gliding of the nerves through the carpal tunnel while moving the elbow, fingers, or wrist.Manual therapy included the incorporation of specified neurodynamic techniques, functional massage, and carpal bone mobilizations. People who receive physical therapy report less pain and an increased functional ability of their wrists and hands.

Self-myofascial ligament stretching has been suggested as an effective technique, although a meta-analysis claimed this form of therapy does not show significant improvement in symptoms or function.However, stretching with a physical therapist can be more beneficial than if the patient stretches alone.Tendon and nerve gliding exercises appear to be useful in carpal tunnel syndrome.


--- Alternative medicine ---


A 2018 Cochrane review on acupuncture and related interventions for the treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome concluded that "Acupuncture and laser acupuncture may have little or no effect in the short term on symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) in comparison with placebo or sham acupuncture." It was also noted that all studies had an unclear or high overall risk of bias and that all evidence was of low or very low quality.
