--- Treatment ---


Steroids are effective at improving recovery in Bell's palsy while antivirals have not.In those who are unable to close their eyes, eye-protective measures are required.Management during pregnancy is similar to management in the non-pregnant.


--- Steroids ---


Corticosteroidssuch asprednisoneimprove recovery at 6 months and are thus recommended.Early treatment (within 3 days after the onset) is necessary for benefitwith a 14% greater probability of recovery.There is some debate regarding the optimal dosing strategy which is generally physician dependent.


--- Antivirals ---


One review found thatantivirals(such asaciclovir) are ineffective in improving recovery from Bell's palsy beyond steroids alone in mild to moderate disease.Another review found a benefit when combined with corticosteroids but stated the evidence was not very good to support this conclusion.

In severe disease, it is also unclear. One 2015 review found no effect regardless of severity.Another review found a small benefit when added to steroids.

They are commonly prescribed due to a theoretical link between Bell's palsy and theherpes simplexandvaricella zoster virus.There is still the possibility that they might result in a benefit less than 7% as this has not been ruled out.


--- Eye protection ---


When Bell's palsy affects the blink reflex and stops the eye from closing completely, frequent use of tear-like eye drops or eye ointments is recommended during the day, and protecting the eyes with patches or taping them shut is recommended for sleep and rest periods.


--- Physiotherapy ---


Physiotherapycan be beneficial to some individuals with Bell's palsy as it helps to maintainmuscle toneof the affectedfacial musclesand stimulate thefacial nerve.It is important that muscle re-education exercises andsoft tissue techniquesbe implemented before recovery to help prevent permanentcontracturesof theparalyzedfacial muscles.To reducepain, heat can be applied to the affected side of the face.There is no high-quality evidence to support the role of electrical stimulation for Bell's palsy.


--- Surgery ---


Surgery may be able to improve outcomes in facial nerve palsy that has not recovered.A number of different techniques exist.Smile surgeryor smile reconstruction is a surgical procedure that may restore the smile for people with facial nerve paralysis. Adverse effects include hearing loss which occurs in 3–15% of people.A Cochrane review (updated in 2021), after reviewing applicablerandomized and quasi-randomized controlled trialswas unable to determine if early surgery is beneficial or harmful.As of 2007 theAmerican Academy of Neurologydid not recommend surgical decompression.


--- Alternative medicine ---


The efficacy ofacupunctureremains unknown because the available studies are of low quality (poor primary study design or inadequate reporting practices).There is very tentative evidence forhyperbaric oxygen therapyin severe disease.
