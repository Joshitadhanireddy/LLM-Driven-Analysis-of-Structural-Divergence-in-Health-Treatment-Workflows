--- Management ---


There is no cure for Marfan syndrome, but life expectancy has increased significantly since the 1970sand is now similar to that of the average person.

Regular checkups are recommended to monitor the health of the heart valves and theaorta. Marfan syndrome is treated by addressing each issue as it arises and, in particular, preventive medication even for young children to slow progression of aortic dilation. The goal of this treatment strategy is to slow the progression of aortic dilation and prevent any damage to heart valves by eliminatingheart arrhythmias, minimizing theheart rate, and lowering the person'sblood pressure.


--- Physical activity ---


TheAmerican Heart Associationmade the following recommendations for people with Marfan syndrome with no or mild aortic dilation:

  - Probably permissible activities:bowling,golf,skating(but notice hockey),snorkeling, brisk walking,treadmill, stationarybiking, modesthiking, andtennis(doublesandsingles).
  - Intermediate risk:basketball(both full- andhalf-court),racquetball,squash, running (sprintingandjogging),skiing(downhillandcross-country),soccer,touch (flag) football,baseball,softball,biking, lapswimming,motorcycling, andhorseback riding.
  - High risk:bodybuilding,weightlifting(non-free andfree weights),ice hockey,rock climbing,windsurfing,surfing, andscuba diving.


--- Medication ---


Management often includes the use ofbeta blockerssuch aspropranololor if not toleratedcalcium channel blockers,ACE inhibitors, and/orangiotensin receptor blockers(ARBs).Beta blockers are used to reduce the stress exerted on the aorta and to decrease aortic dilation.


--- Surgery ---


If the dilation of the aorta progresses to a significant-diameteraneurysm, causes a dissection or a rupture, or leads to failure of the aortic or other valve, then surgery (possibly acomposite aortic valve graftorvalve-sparing aortic root replacement) becomes necessary. Although aortic graft surgery (or any vascular surgery) is a serious undertaking it is generally successful if undertaken on an elective basis.Surgery in the setting of acute aortic dissection or rupture is considerably more problematic. Elective aortic valve/graft surgery is usually considered when aortic root diameter reaches 50 millimeters (2.0 inches), but each case needs to be specifically evaluated by a qualified cardiologist. New valve-sparing surgical techniques are becoming more common.As people with Marfan syndrome survive aortic root enlargement and dissections of the ascending aorta, other vascular repairs are becoming more common, e.g., repairs of descending thoracic aortic aneurysms and aneurysms of vessels other than the aorta, such as the subclavian arteries.

The skeletal and ocular manifestations of Marfan syndrome can also be serious, although not life-threatening. These symptoms are usually treated in an appropriate manner for the condition, such as with pain medications ormuscle relaxants. Because Marfan syndrome may cause asymptomatic spinal abnormalities, any spinal surgery contemplated on a person with Marfan should only follow detailed imaging and careful surgical planning, regardless of the indication for surgery. The ocular complications of MFS can often be treated with surgery.Ectopia lentiscan be treated, as artificial lenses can be surgically implanted. In addition, surgery can addressglaucoma,retinal detachmentor tears, andcataracts.

Treatment of a spontaneous pneumothorax is dependent on the volume of air in the pleural space and the natural progression of the individual's condition. A small pneumothorax might resolve without active treatment in one to two weeks. Recurrent pneumothoraces might require chest surgery. Moderately sized pneumothoraces might needchest drainmanagement for several days in a hospital. Large pneumothoraces are likely to be medical emergencies requiring emergency decompression.

As an alternative approach, custom-built supports for the aortic root are also being used.As of 2020 this procedure has been used in over 300 people with the first case occurring in 2004.


--- Pregnancy ---


During pregnancy, even in the absence of preconception cardiovascular abnormality, women with Marfan syndrome are at significant risk of aortic dissection, which is often fatal even when rapidly treated. Women with Marfan syndrome, then, should receive a thorough assessment prior to conception, andechocardiographyshould be performed every six to 10 weeks during pregnancy, to assess the aortic root diameter. For most women, safe vaginal delivery is possible.

Prenatal testingcan be performed in females with Marfan syndrome to determine if the condition has been inherited in their child.At 10 to 12 weeks of pregnancy, examining a piece of placental tissue through a test called chorionic villus sampling can be performed to make a diagnosis.Another prenatal test can be performed calledamniocentesisat 16 to 18 weeks of pregnancy.

Marfan syndrome is expressed dominantly. This means a child with one parent a bearer of the gene has a 50% probability of getting the syndrome. In 1996, the firstpreimplantation genetic testing(PGT) therapy for Marfan was conducted;in essence PGT means conducting a genetic test on early-stageIVFembryo cells and discarding those embryos affected by the Marfan mutation.
