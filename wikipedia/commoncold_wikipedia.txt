--- Management ---


Treatments of the common cold primarily involvemedications and other therapies for symptomatic relief.Getting plenty of rest, drinking fluids to maintain hydration, andgarglingwith warm salt water are reasonable conservative measures.Much of the benefit from symptomatic treatment is, however, attributed to theplacebo effect.As of 2010,[update]no medications or herbal remedies had been conclusively demonstrated to shorten the duration of infection.


--- Symptomatic ---


Treatments that may help with symptoms includepain medicationandmedications for feverssuch asibuprofenandacetaminophen (paracetamol).However, it is not clear whether acetaminophen helps with symptoms.It is not known if over-the-countercough medicationsare effective for treating anacutecough.Cough medicines are not recommended for use in children due to a lack of evidence supporting effectiveness and the potential for harm.In 2009, Canada restricted the use ofover-the-countercough and cold medication in children six years and under due to concerns regarding risks and unproven benefits.The misuse ofdextromethorphan(an over-the-counter cough medicine) has led to its ban in a number of countries.Intranasal corticosteroidshave not been found to be useful.

In adults, short term use ofnasal decongestantsmay have a small benefit.Antihistaminesmay improve symptoms in the first day or two; however, there is no longer-term benefit and they have adverse effects such as drowsiness.Other decongestants such aspseudoephedrineappear effective in adults.Combined oral analgesics, antihistaminics, and decongestants are generally effective for older children and adults.Ipratropiumnasal spray may reduce the symptoms of a runny nose but has little effect on stuffiness.Ipratropium may also help with coughs in adults.The safety and effectiveness of nasal decongestant use in children is unclear.

Due to lack of studies, it is not known whether increased fluid intake improves symptoms or shortens respiratory illness.As of 2017, heated and humidified air, such as via RhinoTherm, is of unclear benefit.One study has foundchest vapor rubto provide some relief of nocturnal cough, congestion, and sleep difficulty.

Some experts  advise againstphysical exerciseif there are symptoms such as fever, widespreadmuscle achesorfatigue.It is regarded as safe to perform moderate exercise if the symptoms are confined to thehead, includingrunny nose,nasal congestion,sneezing, or a minorsore throat.There is a popular belief that having a hot drink can help with cold symptoms, but evidence to support this is very limited.


--- Antibiotics and antivirals ---


Antibioticshave no effect against viral infections, including the common cold.Due to their side effects, antibiotics cause overall harm but nevertheless are still frequently prescribed.Some of the reasons that antibiotics are so commonly prescribed include people's expectations for them, physicians' desire to help, and the difficulty in excluding complications that may be amenable to antibiotics.There are no effectiveantiviral drugsfor the common cold even though some preliminary research has shown benefits.


--- Zinc ---


Zinc supplementsmay shorten the duration of colds by up to 33% and reduce the severity of symptoms if supplementation begins within 24 hours of the onset of symptoms.Some zinc remedies directly applied to the inside of the nose have led to theloss of the sense of smell.A 2017 review did not recommend the use of zinc for the common cold for various reasons;whereas a 2017 and 2018 review both recommended the use of zinc, but also advocated further research on the topic.


--- Alternative medicine ---


While there are manyalternative medicinesandChinese herbal medicinessupposed to treat the common cold, there is insufficientscientific evidenceto support their use.As of 2015, there is weak evidence to supportnasal irrigationwithsaline.There is no firm evidence thatEchinaceaproducts orgarlicprovide any meaningful benefit in treating or preventing colds.


--- Vitamins C and D ---


Vitamin Csupplementationdoes not affect the incidence of the common cold, but may reduce its duration if taken on a regular basis.There is no conclusive evidence thatvitamin Dsupplementation is efficacious in the prevention or treatment of respiratory tract infections.
