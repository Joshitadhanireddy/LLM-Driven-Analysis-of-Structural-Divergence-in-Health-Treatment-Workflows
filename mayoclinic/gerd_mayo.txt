--- GERD Treatment Plan (Extracted from Mayo Clinic) ---

A healthcare professional is likely to recommend trying lifestyle changes and nonprescription medicines as a first line of treatment. If you don't experience relief within a few weeks, prescription medicine and additional testing may be recommended.


## Nonprescription medicines


Options include:


Antacids that neutralize stomach acid.
Antacids containing calcium carbonate, such as Mylanta, Rolaids and Tums, may provide quick relief. But antacids alone won't heal an inflamed esophagus damaged by stomach acid. Overuse of some antacids can cause side effects, such as diarrhea or sometimes kidney complications.
Medicines to reduce acid production.
These medicines — known as histamine (H-2) blockers — include cimetidine (Tagamet HB), famotidine (Pepcid AC) and nizatidine (Axid). H-2 blockers don't act as quickly as antacids, but they provide longer relief and may decrease acid production from the stomach for up to 12 hours. Stronger versions are available by prescription.
Medicines that block acid production and heal the esophagus.
These medicines — known as proton pump inhibitors — are stronger acid blockers than H-2 blockers and allow time for damaged esophageal tissue to heal. Nonprescription proton pump inhibitors include lansoprazole (Prevacid), omeprazole (Prilosec OTC) and esomeprazole (Nexium).


If you start taking a nonprescription medicine for GERD, be sure to inform your care provider.


## Prescription medicines


Prescription-strength treatments for GERD include:


Prescription-strength proton pump inhibitors.
These include esomeprazole (Nexium), lansoprazole (Prevacid), omeprazole (Prilosec), pantoprazole (Protonix), rabeprazole (Aciphex) and dexlansoprazole (Dexilant).
Although generally well tolerated, these medicines might cause diarrhea, headaches, nausea or, in rare instances, low vitamin B-12 or magnesium levels.
Prescription-strength H-2 blockers.
These include prescription-strength famotidine and nizatidine. Side effects from these medicines are generally mild and well tolerated.
Potassium-competitive acid blockers (P-CABs).
This new class of medicines may be recommended for someone with severe acid reflux if other medicines haven't worked. They include vonoprazan (Voquezna) and tegoprazan (K-Cab).



## Deep-breathing training


A technique known as diaphragmatic breathing may help improve GERD symptoms for some people. This exercise is done after eating. It involves breathing deeply into the diaphragm rather than shallowly into the chest. Diaphragmatic breathing techniques should ideally be taught by a trained medical professional.


## Surgery and other procedures


GERD can usually be controlled with medicine. But if medicines don't help or you wish to avoid long-term medicine use, a healthcare professional might recommend:


Fundoplication.
The surgeon wraps the top of the stomach around the lower esophageal sphincter, to tighten the muscle and prevent reflux. Fundoplication is usually done with a minimally invasive, called laparoscopic, procedure. The wrapping of the top part of the stomach can be partial or complete, known as Nissen fundoplication. The most common partial procedure is the Toupet fundoplication. Your surgeon typically recommends the type that is best for you.
LINX device.
A ring of tiny magnetic beads is wrapped around the junction of the stomach and esophagus. The magnetic attraction between the beads is strong enough to keep the junction closed to refluxing acid, but weak enough to allow food to pass through. The LINX device can be implanted using minimally invasive surgery. The magnetic beads do not affect airport security or magnetic resonance imaging.
Transoral incisionless fundoplication (TIF).
This new procedure involves tightening the lower esophageal sphincter by creating a partial wrap around the lower esophagus using polypropylene fasteners. TIF is performed through the mouth by using an endoscope and requires no surgical incision. Its advantages include quick recovery time and high tolerance.
If you have a large hiatal hernia, TIF alone is not an option. However, TIF may be possible if it is combined with laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair.


Because obesity can be a risk factor for GERD, a healthcare professional could suggest weight-loss surgery as an option for treatment. Talk with your healthcare team to find out if you're a candidate for this type of surgery.
