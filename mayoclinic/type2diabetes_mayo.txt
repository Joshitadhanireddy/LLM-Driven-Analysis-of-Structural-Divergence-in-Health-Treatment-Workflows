--- Type 2 Diabetes Treatment Plan (Extracted from Mayo Clinic) ---

Living with type 2 diabetes involves learning about the condition and lifestyle changes. Diabetes education is an important part of managing the condition. Management includes:


Healthy eating.
Regular exercise.
Weight loss if needed.
Diabetes medicine or insulin therapy if needed.
Keeping track of blood sugar.


These steps make it more likely that blood sugar will stay in a healthy range. And they may help delay or prevent complications.


## Healthy eating


There's no diabetes diet. But it's good to focus your eating on:


A regular schedule for meals and healthy snacks.
Smaller amounts of food.
More high-fiber foods, such as fruits, nonstarchy vegetables and whole grains.
Fewer refined grains, starchy vegetables and sweets.
Modest servings of low-fat dairy, low-fat meats and fish.
Healthy cooking oils, such as olive oil or canola oil.
Fewer calories.


You may see a registered dietitian, who can help you:


Make healthy food choices.
Plan healthy meals.
Make new habits and learn what stops you from changing habits.
Watch carbohydrate intake to keep your blood sugar levels more stable.



## Physical activity


Exercise is important to lose weight or stay at a healthy weight. It also helps manage blood sugar. Talk with your healthcare team before starting or changing your exercise program to make sure the activities are safe for you.


Aerobic activity.
Choose activities that you enjoy. Try walking, swimming, biking or running. Aim to get about 30 minutes or more of moderate aerobic exercise on most days of the week, or at least 150 minutes a week.
Strength training.
Strength training increases your strength, balance and ability to do activities of daily living. Strength training can be done using free weights, resistance tubes, weight machines or your  body weight for resistance. Aim to do strength training exercises for all major muscle groups at least two times a week.
Move more.
Breaking up long periods of inactivity, such as sitting at the computer, can help control blood sugar levels. Take a few minutes to stand, walk around or do some light activity every 30 minutes.



## Weight loss


Losing weight can help you manage blood sugar levels, cholesterol, triglycerides and blood pressure. If you're overweight, you may see these factors improve after you lose as little as 5% of your body weight. The more weight you lose, the better it is for your health.

Your healthcare professional or dietitian can help you set good weight-loss goals and make lifestyle changes to help you reach them.


## Tracking your blood sugar


Your healthcare team will tell you how often to check your blood sugar level. This is to make sure that your blood sugar stays in the target range. You may, for instance, need to check it once a day and before or after exercise. If you take insulin, you may need to check your blood sugar several times a day.

You can use a small, at-home device called a blood glucose meter. This measures the amount of sugar in a drop of blood. Keep a record to share with your healthcare team.

Continuous glucose monitoring is an electronic system that records blood sugar levels every few minutes from a sensor put under the skin. The sensor most often is in the arm. The system can send results to a mobile device such as a phone. And the system can alert you when levels are too high or too low.


## Diabetes medicines


If you can't stay at your target blood sugar level with diet and exercise, your healthcare team may prescribe diabetes medicines that help lower glucose levels. Or you may start insulin therapy. Medicines for type 2 diabetes include the following.

Metformin (Fortamet, Glumetza, others)
is most often the first medicine prescribed for type 2 diabetes. It works mainly in two ways. It lowers the amount of glucose the liver makes. And it helps the body use insulin better.

Some people who take metformin, may get B-12 deficiency and may need to take supplements. There are other side effects that may get better over time. Side effects might include:


Nausea.
Belly pain.
Bloating.
Diarrhea.


Sulfonylureas
help the body make more insulin. These include glipizide (Glucotrol XL) and glimepiride (Amaryl). Side effects might include:


Low blood sugar.
Weight gain.


Another sulfonylurea is glyburide (DiaBeta, Glynase). It has a higher risk of low blood sugar.

Glinides
help the pancreas to make more insulin. They work faster than sulfonylureas. But their effect doesn't last as long. They include repaglinide and nateglinide. Side effects might include:


Low blood sugar.
Weight gain.


Thiazolidinediones
help the body's tissues take in more insulin. These include pioglitazone (Actos) and rosiglitazone. Side effects might include:


Weight gain.
Broken bones.
Fluid retention.
Heart failure.


DPP-4 inhibitors
help lower blood sugar levels. But they tend to have only a small effect. Medicines include alogliptin (Nesina), sitagliptin (Januvia), saxagliptin and linagliptin (Tradjenta). Side effects might include:


Pancreatitis.
Joint pain.


GLP-1 receptor agonists
are medicines taken by shot, called injection. They slow digestion and help lower blood sugar levels. Their use is often linked with weight loss. Some lower the risk of heart attack and stroke.

These medicines include dulaglutide (Trulicity) exenatide (Byetta, Bydureon Bcise), liraglutide (Saxenda, Victoza) and semaglutide (Rybelsus, Ozempic, Wegovy). Side effects might include:


Nausea.
Vomiting.
Diarrhea.


SGLT2 inhibitors
affect the how the kidneys filter blood. They block the return of glucose to the bloodstream. Excess glucose then leaves the body in the urine. These medicines may lower the risk of heart attack and stroke in people with a high risk of those conditions.

These medicines include canagliflozin (Invokana), dapagliflozin (Farxiga) and empagliflozin (Jardiance). Side effects might include:


Vaginal yeast infections.
Urinary tract infections.
Low blood pressure.
High cholesterol.
Gangrene.
Broken bones.
Risk of amputation.


Other medicines
your healthcare professional might prescribe are medicines to lower blood pressure and cholesterol. Low-dose aspirin may help prevent heart and blood vessel conditions.


## Insulin therapy


Some people who have type 2 diabetes need insulin therapy. In the past, people tried insulin therapy only after other treatments had failed. But today, it may be prescribed sooner if lifestyle changes and other medicines don't manage blood sugar levels.

Insulin types vary by how quickly they work and how long they last. Long-acting insulin, for instance, works overnight or throughout the day to keep blood sugar levels even. People most often take short-acting insulin at mealtimes.

Your healthcare professional prescribes the type of insulin that's right for you and advises you when to take it. Your insulin type, dosage and schedule may change. That depends on how stable your blood sugar levels are. People take most types of insulin as an injection.

A side effect of insulin is low blood sugar, called hypoglycemia.


## Weight-loss surgery


Weight-loss surgery changes the shape of the digestive system and how it works. This surgery may help you lose weight and manage type 2 diabetes and other conditions linked to obesity.

There are a few surgical procedures. All of them help people lose weight by limiting how much food they can eat. Some procedures also limit the amount of nutrients the body can absorb.

Weight-loss surgery is only one part of an overall treatment plan. Treatment also includes diet and nutritional supplements, exercise and mental health care.

Weight-loss surgery may be a choice for adults living with type 2 diabetes who have a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher. BMI is a formula that uses weight and height to estimate body fat. Surgery also may be a choice for someone with a BMI lower than 35. This depends on how bad the diabetes is or whether there are other medical conditions.

If you have weight-loss surgery, you need to make lifestyle changes for life. Long-term side effects may include not taking in enough nutrients and the bone-loss condition, osteoporosis.


## Pregnancy


People who have type 2 diabetes often need to change their treatment plan during pregnancy and follow a diet that controls carbohydrates. Many people need insulin therapy during pregnancy. They also may need to stop other treatments, such as certain blood pressure medicines.

You have a higher risk during pregnancy of getting a condition that affects the eyes, called diabetic retinopathy. This condition may get worse during pregnancy.

If you're pregnant, visit a specialist in eye care, called an ophthalmologist. Go each trimester of your pregnancy and one year after you give birth. Or go as often as your healthcare team advises.


## Signs of trouble


You need to track your blood sugar levels to keep from getting serious complications. Also, know of symptoms that may mean that blood sugar levels need care right away. They include:

High blood sugar.
This condition also is called hyperglycemia. Eating certain foods or too much food, being sick, or not taking diabetes medicines at the right time can cause high blood sugar. Symptoms include:


Urinating often.
Extreme thirst.
Dry mouth.
Blurred vision.
Tiredness.
Headache.


Hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome.
Also called HHNS, this life-threatening condition includes a blood sugar reading higher than 600 mg/dL (33.3 mmol/L). HHNS may be more likely if you have an infection, don't take medicines as prescribed, or take certain steroids or other medicines that cause you to urinate often. Symptoms include:


Dry mouth.
Extreme thirst.
Drowsiness.
Confusion.
Dark urine.
Seizures.


Diabetic ketoacidosis.
Diabetic ketoacidosis happens when a lack of insulin results in the body breaking down fat for fuel rather than sugar. This causes a buildup of acids called ketones in the bloodstream.

Triggers of diabetic ketoacidosis include certain illnesses, pregnancy and medicines. The diabetes medicines called SGLT2 inhibitors can increase the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, especially when used in people living with type 1 diabetes.

Diabetic ketoacidosis makes acids that are toxic. So the condition can be life-threatening. Besides the symptoms of hyperglycemia, such as urinating often and more thirst, ketoacidosis may cause:


Nausea.
Vomiting.
Belly pain.
Shortness of breath.
Fruity-smelling breath.


Low blood sugar.
Low blood sugar is when blood sugar levels drop below the target range. This condition also is called hypoglycemia. Your blood sugar level can drop for many reasons. These include missing a meal, taking more medicine than usual or being more physically active than usual. Symptoms include:


Sweating.
Shakiness.
Weakness.
Hunger.
Irritability.
Dizziness.
Headache.
Blurred vision.
Heart palpitations.
Slurred speech.
Drowsiness.
Confusion.


If you have symptoms of low blood sugar, drink or eat something that raises your blood sugar level quickly. Try fruit juice, sugared soda, glucose tablets, hard candy or another source of sugar. Retest your blood in 15 minutes.

If levels are not at your target, eat or drink another source of sugar. Eat a meal after your blood sugar level returns to normal.

If you pass out, someone needs to give you a shot of glucagon. This hormone causes the release of sugar into the blood.
