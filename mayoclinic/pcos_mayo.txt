--- PCOS Treatment Plan (Extracted from Mayo Clinic) ---

PCOS
treatment focuses on managing the things that are concerning you. This could include infertility, hirsutism, acne or obesity. Specific treatment might involve lifestyle changes or medication.


## Lifestyle changes


Your health care provider may recommend weight loss through a low-calorie diet combined with moderate exercise activities. Even a modest reduction in your weight — for example, losing 5% of your body weight — might improve your condition. Losing weight may increase the effectiveness of medications your provider recommends for
PCOS
, and it can help with infertility. Your health care provider and a registered dietitian can work with you to determine the best weight-loss plan.


## Medications


To regulate your periods, your health care provider might recommend:


Combination birth control pills.
Pills that contain both estrogen and progestin decrease androgen production and regulate estrogen. Regulating your hormones can lower your risk of endometrial cancer and correct irregular bleeding, excess hair growth and acne.
Progestin therapy.
Taking progestin for 10 to 14 days every 1 to 2 months can regulate your periods and protect against endometrial cancer. This progestin therapy doesn't improve androgen levels and won't prevent pregnancy. The progestin-only minipill or progestin-containing intrauterine device is a better choice if you also wish to avoid pregnancy.


To help you ovulate so that you can become pregnant, your health care provider might recommend:


Clomiphene.
This oral anti-estrogen medication is taken during the first part of your menstrual cycle.
Letrozole (Femara).
This breast cancer treatment can work to stimulate the ovaries.
Metformin.
This medicine for type 2 diabetes that you take by mouth improves insulin resistance and lowers insulin levels. If you don't become pregnant using clomiphene, your provider might recommend adding metformin to help you ovulate. If you have prediabetes, metformin can slow the progression to type 2 diabetes and help with weight loss.
Gonadotropins.
These hormone medications are given by injection.


If needed, talk with your health care provider about procedures that may help you become pregnant. For example, in vitro fertilization may be an option.

To reduce excessive hair growth or improve acne, your health care provider might recommend:


Birth control pills.
These pills decrease androgen production that can cause excessive hair growth and acne.
Spironolactone (Aldactone).
This medication blocks the effects of androgen on the skin, including excessive hair growth and acne. Spironolactone can cause birth defects, so effective birth control is needed while taking this medication. This medication isn't recommended if you're pregnant or planning to become pregnant.
Eflornithine (Vaniqa).
This cream can slow facial hair growth.
Hair removal.
Electrolysis and laser hair removal are two options for removing hair. Electrolysis uses a tiny needle inserted into each hair follicle. The needle sends out a pulse of electric current. The current damages and then destroys the follicle. Laser hair removal is a medical procedure that uses a concentrated beam of light to remove unwanted hair. You might need multiple treatments of electrolysis or laser hair removal. Shaving, plucking or using creams that dissolve unwanted hair may be other options. But these are temporary, and hair may thicken when it grows back.
Acne treatments.
Medications, including pills and topical creams or gels, may help improve acne. Talk to your health care provider about options.
