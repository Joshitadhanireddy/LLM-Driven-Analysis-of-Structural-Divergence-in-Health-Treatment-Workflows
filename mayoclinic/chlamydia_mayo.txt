--- Chlamydia Tunnel Syndrome Treatment Plan (Extracted from Mayo Clinic) ---

Chlamydia trachomatis is treated with antibiotics. You will likely need to take a medicine for seven days, or you may be given a one-time dose of a medicine.

In most cases, the infection clears up within 1 to 2 weeks after you take the antibiotic. But you can still spread the infection at first. So avoid sexual activity from when you start treatment until all your symptoms are gone.

Your sexual partner or partners from the last 60 days also need screening and treatment even if they don't have symptoms. Otherwise, the infection can be passed back and forth between sexual partners. Make sure to avoid sexual contact until all exposed partners are treated.

Having chlamydia or having been treated for it in the past doesn't prevent you from getting it again.

Three months after treatment, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends getting tested for chlamydia again. This is to make sure people haven't been reinfected with the bacteria, which can happen if sex partners aren't treated, or new sex partners have the bacteria.
