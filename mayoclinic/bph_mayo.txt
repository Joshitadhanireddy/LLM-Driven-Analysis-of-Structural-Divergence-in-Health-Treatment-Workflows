--- BPH Treatment Plan (Extracted from Mayo Clinic) ---

Many treatments are available for enlarged prostate. These include medicines, surgery and procedures that involve smaller, fewer or no cuts. The best treatment choice for you depends on:


The size of your prostate.
Your age.
Your overall health.
How serious your symptoms are.


If your symptoms don't get in the way of your life, you might decide to put off treatment. Instead, you could wait to see if your symptoms change or get worse. For some people, symptoms of
BPH
can ease without treatment.


## Medicines for an enlarged prostate


Taking medicine is the most common treatment for mild to moderate symptoms of an enlarged prostate. Options include:


Alpha blockers.
Alpha blockers work by relaxing the smooth muscle of the bladder neck and prostate. This makes peeing easier. Alpha blockers include alfuzosin (Uroxatral), doxazosin (Cardura), tamsulosin (Flomax) silodosin (Rapaflo) and terazosin. They often work quickly in people with somewhat smaller prostates. Side effects might include dizziness. They also may include a harmless issue in which semen goes back into the bladder instead of out the tip of the penis. This is called retrograde ejaculation.
5-alpha reductase inhibitors.
These medicines shrink the prostate. They do this by preventing hormone changes that cause the prostate to grow. Examples include finasteride (Proscar) and dutasteride (Avodart). They might take up to six months to work well and can cause sexual side effects.
Combination therapy.
Your health care provider might suggest that you take an alpha blocker and a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor at the same time if either medicine alone doesn't help enough.
Tadalafil (Cialis).
This medicine is often used to treat erectile dysfunction. Studies suggest it also can treat an enlarged prostate.



## Surgery and other treatments for an enlarged prostate


Surgery or other procedures might help with
BPH
symptoms if you:


Don't get enough relief from medicines.
Prefer not to try medicine.
Aren't able to pee.
Have kidney problems.
Keep getting bladder stones, blood in the urine or
UTIs
.


Surgery or other procedures might not be an option if you have:


An untreated urinary tract infection.
Urethral stricture disease.
A history of prostate radiation therapy or urinary tract surgery.
A neurological disorder, such as Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis.


Any type of prostate procedure can cause side effects. Depending on the procedure you choose, health issues afterward might include:


Semen flowing backward into the bladder instead of out through the penis during ejaculation.
Leaking urine by accident.
Urinary tract infection.
Bleeding.
Erectile dysfunction.


There are many types of surgeries and other procedures that can treat an enlarged prostate.


## Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP)


A thin tool with a light, called a scope, is inserted into the urethra. The surgeon removes all but the outer part of the prostate.
TURP
often relieves symptoms quickly. Some people have a stronger urine flow soon after the procedure too. After
TURP
, you might need a catheter to drain your bladder for a little while.


## Transurethral incision of the prostate (TUIP)


A lighted scope is inserted into the urethra. The surgeon makes one or two small cuts in the prostate gland. This makes it easier for urine to pass through the urethra.
TUIP
might be an option if you have a small or slightly enlarged prostate gland. It also may be an option if you have health problems that make other surgeries too risky.


## Transurethral microwave thermotherapy (TUMT)


A special catheter is placed through the urethra into the prostate area. Microwave energy from the catheter destroys the inner portion of the enlarged prostate gland. This shrinks the prostate and eases urine flow.
TUMT
might relieve only some of your symptoms. It also might take some time before you notice results. In general, this surgery is used only on small prostates in special situations because the treatment might be needed again.


## Laser therapy


A high-energy laser destroys or removes overgrown prostate tissue. Laser therapy has a lower risk of side effects than does nonlaser surgery. It might be used in people who shouldn't have other prostate procedures because they take blood-thinning medicines.

Laser therapy options include:


Ablative procedures.
These destroy prostate tissue that blocks urine flow. Types of these procedures include photoselective vaporization of the prostate (PVP) and holmium laser ablation of the prostate. Ablative procedures can cause irritating symptoms after surgery. In rare cases, another procedure to remove prostate tissue might be needed at some point.
Enucleative procedures.
These treatments include holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP). In general, they remove all the prostate tissue blocking urine flow and prevent tissue from growing back. The removed tissue can be checked for prostate cancer and other health problems.



## Prostate lift


Special tags are used to compress the sides of the prostate. This can improve the flow of urine. A prostate lift might be an option if the middle section of the prostate gland doesn't get in the way of urine flow. It's less likely to cause sexual side effects than are many other surgical treatments.


## Water vapor thermal therapy (WVTT)


A device is placed in the urethra. It turns water into steam. This wears away extra prostate tissue.
WVTT
can ease symptoms of an enlarged prostate. It is less likely to cause sexual side effects compared with many other surgical treatments.


## Robotic waterjet treatment


This procedure uses imaging tests and robotic tools to guide a device into the urethra. The device releases tiny, powerful jets of water to remove extra prostate tissue. This can ease symptoms of an enlarged prostate. Robotic waterjet treatment can cause some of the same side effects that
TURP
can cause.


## Open or robot-assisted prostatectomy


One or more cuts are made in the lower stomach area. This lets the surgeon reach the prostate and remove tissue. In general, this type of surgery is done if you have a large or very large prostate. A short hospital stay is often needed afterward. The surgery is linked with a higher risk of needing donated blood due to bleeding.


## Prostate artery embolization (PAE)


You may be offered prostate artery embolization as a treatment option for
BPH
. In this procedure, the blood supply to the prostate is blocked in chosen areas. This causes the prostate to get smaller. Evidence suggests there may be both short-term and long-term benefits of this procedure, including improved urinary symptoms, for certain people with
BPH
.

It's important to talk with your healthcare team about the risks and benefits of this procedure.
PAE
should be done only by a healthcare professional who has been specially trained to perform
PAE
procedures. This type of healthcare professional is called an interventional radiologist. This is a doctor with special training in performing procedures done using imaging methods, such as X-ray, MRI or ultrasound, to guide them.


## Follow-up care


Your follow-up care will depend on the technique used to treat your enlarged prostate. Your health care provider should tell you what activities to stay away from and for how long.


## Treatment at Mayo Clinic


Mayo Clinic experts have training in a wide range of state-of-the-art technology to treat an enlarged prostate. You have access to the latest noninvasive laser treatments, including
HoLEP
and
PVP
lasers. Your Mayo Clinic care team will explain the range of treatments available and help you choose the best approach based on your symptoms.
