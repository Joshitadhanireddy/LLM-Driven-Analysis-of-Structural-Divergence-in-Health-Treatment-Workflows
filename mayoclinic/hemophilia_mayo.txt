--- Hemophilia Treatment Plan (Extracted from Mayo Clinic) ---

The main treatment for severe hemophilia involves replacing the clotting factor you need through a tube in a vein.

This replacement therapy can be given to treat a bleeding episode in progress. It can also be given on a regular schedule at home to help prevent bleeding episodes. Some people receive continuous replacement therapy.

Replacement clotting factor can be made from donated blood. Similar products, called recombinant clotting factors, are made in a laboratory, not from human blood.

Other therapies include:


Desmopressin.
In some forms of mild hemophilia, this hormone can stimulate the body to release more clotting factor. It can be injected slowly into a vein or used as a nasal spray.
Emicizumab (Hemlibra).
This is a newer drug that doesn't include clotting factors. This drug can help prevent bleeding episodes in people with hemophilia A.
Clot-preserving medications.
Also known as anti-fibrinolytics, these medications help prevent clots from breaking down.
Fibrin sealants.
These can be applied directly to wound sites to promote clotting and healing. Fibrin sealants are especially useful for dental work.
Physical therapy.
It can ease signs and symptoms if internal bleeding has damaged your joints. Severe damage might require surgery.
First aid for minor cuts.
Using pressure and a bandage will generally take care of the bleeding. For small areas of bleeding beneath the skin, use an ice pack. Ice pops can be used to slow down minor bleeding in the mouth.
