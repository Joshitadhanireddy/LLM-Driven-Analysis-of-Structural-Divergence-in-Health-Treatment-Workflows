--- Marfan Syndrome Treatment Plan (Extracted from Mayo Clinic) ---

While there is no cure for Marfan syndrome, treatment focuses on preventing the various complications of the disease. To accomplish this, you'll need to be checked regularly for signs that the damage caused by the disease is progressing.

In the past, people who had Marfan syndrome often died young. With regular monitoring and modern treatment, most people with Marfan syndrome can now expect to live a more normal life span.


## Medications


Doctors often prescribe blood pressure lowering drugs to help prevent the aorta from enlarging and to reduce the risk of dissection and rupture.


## Therapy


The vision problems associated with a dislocated lens in your eye often can be corrected with glasses or contact lenses.


## Surgical and other procedures


Depending on your signs and symptoms, procedures might include:


Aortic repair.
If your aorta's diameter reaches about 2 inches (50 millimeters) or if it enlarges rapidly, your doctor may recommend an operation to replace a portion of your aorta with a tube made of synthetic material. This can help prevent a life-threatening rupture. Your aortic valve may need to be replaced as well.
Scoliosis treatment.
When there is significant scoliosis, a consultation with a spine expert is necessary. Bracing and surgery are needed in some cases.
Breastbone corrections.
Surgical options are available to correct the appearance of a sunken or protruding breastbone. Because these operations are often considered to be for cosmetic purposes, your insurance might not cover the costs.
Eye surgeries.
If parts of your retina have torn or come loose from the back of your eye, surgical repair is usually successful. If you have cataracts, your clouded lens can be replaced with an artificial lens.
