--- Tetanus Treatment Plan (Extracted from Mayo Clinic) ---

A tetanus infection requires emergency and long-term supportive care while the disease runs its course, often in an intensive care unit. Any wounds are cared for and the healthcare team will make sure that the ability to breathe is protected.  Medicines are given that ease symptoms, target the bacteria, target the toxin made by the bacteria and boost immune system response.

The disease progresses for about two weeks, and recovery can last about a month.


## Wound care


Care for your wound requires cleaning to remove dirt, debris or foreign objects that may be harboring bacteria. Your care team will also clear the wound of any dead tissue that could provide an environment in which bacteria can grow.


## Medications



Antitoxin
therapy is used to target toxins that have not yet attacked nerve tissues. This treatment, called passive immunization, is a human antibody to the toxin.
Sedatives
that slow the function of the nervous system can help control muscle spasms.
Vaccination
with one of the standard tetanus vaccinations helps your immune system fight the toxins.
Antibiotics
, given either orally or by injection, may help fight tetanus bacteria.
Other drugs.
Other medications might be used to regulate involuntary muscle activity, such as your heartbeat and breathing. Morphine might be used for this purpose as well as for sedation.



## Supportive therapies


Supportive therapies include treatments to make sure your airway is clear and to provide breathing assistance. A feeding tube into the stomach is used to provide nutrients. The care environment is intended to reduce sounds, light or other possible triggers of generalized spasms.
