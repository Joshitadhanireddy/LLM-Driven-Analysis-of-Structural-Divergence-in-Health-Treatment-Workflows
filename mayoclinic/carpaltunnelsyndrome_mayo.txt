--- Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Treatment Plan (Extracted from Mayo Clinic) ---

Treat carpal tunnel syndrome as early as possible after symptoms start. In the early stages, simple things that you can do for yourself may make the symptoms go away. For example:


Take more-frequent breaks to rest the hands.
Don't do activities that make symptoms worse.
Use cold packs to reduce swelling.


Other treatment options include wrist splinting, medicines and surgery. Splinting and other conservative treatments are more likely to help if you've had only mild to moderate symptoms that come and go for less than 10 months.

If you have numbness in your hands, get treatment from a healthcare professional.


## Nonsurgical therapy


If the condition is diagnosed early, nonsurgical methods may help improve carpal tunnel syndrome, including:


Wrist splinting.
A splint that holds the wrist still while you sleep can help relieve nighttime symptoms of tingling and numbness. Even though you only wear the splint at night, it also can help prevent daytime symptoms. Nighttime splinting may be a good option if you're pregnant because it does not involve the use of any medicines to be effective.
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
NSAIDs
, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), may help relieve pain from carpal tunnel syndrome in the short term.
There isn't evidence, however, that these medicines improve carpal tunnel syndrome.
Corticosteroids.
Your healthcare professional may inject the carpal tunnel with a corticosteroid medicine such as cortisone to relieve pain. Sometimes an ultrasound is used to guide these injections.
Corticosteroids decrease inflammation and swelling, which relieves pressure on the median nerve. Oral corticosteroids aren't considered as effective as corticosteroid injections for treating carpal tunnel syndrome.


If carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by rheumatoid arthritis or another inflammatory arthritis, then treating the arthritis may reduce symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome. However, this has not been proved by research.


## Surgery


Surgery may be appropriate if symptoms are severe or don't respond to other treatments.

The goal of carpal tunnel surgery is to relieve pressure by cutting the ligament pressing on the median nerve.

Three different techniques are used in carpal tunnel surgery:


Endoscopic surgery.
A surgeon uses a telescope-like device with a tiny camera called an endoscope. This allows the surgeon to see inside the carpal tunnel. The surgeon cuts the ligament through one or two small incisions in the hand or wrist.
Endoscopic surgery may result in less pain than does open surgery in the first few days or weeks after surgery.
Open surgery.
A surgeon makes a cut, also called an incision, in the palm of the hand over the carpal tunnel and cuts through the ligament to free the nerve.
Ultrasound-guided surgery.
This surgery is similar to endoscopic surgery, but the surgeon uses ultrasound to see the nerve, tendons, arteries and ligament. Then the surgeon cuts the ligament either with a small knife or with a braided wire put into the wrist through a needle.


Discuss the risks and benefits of each technique with your surgeon before surgery. Surgery risks may include:


Incomplete release of the ligament.
Wound infections.
Scar formation.
Injuries to nerves or blood vessels.


During the healing process after the surgery, the ligament tissues gradually grow back together while allowing more room for the nerve. This internal healing process typically takes several months, but the skin heals in a few weeks.

Your surgeon likely will recommend that you use the hand after the ligament has healed. Slowly work back to full use of the hand and do not use forceful hand motions or extreme wrist positions.

Soreness or weakness may take from several weeks to a few months to resolve after surgery. If your symptoms were very severe, they may not completely go away after surgery.
