HEMOPHILIA MANAGEMENT WORKFLOW (from Mayo Clinic-based plan)

1. Core treatment principle
   - Replace missing clotting factor via IV infusion.
   - Use:
     * On-demand for active bleeds.
     * Scheduled prophylaxis at home.
     * Continuous replacement in selected severe cases.

2. Factor replacement options
   - Plasma-derived clotting factor concentrates.
   - Recombinant clotting factors produced in lab (no human blood).

3. Adjunctive therapies
   - Desmopressin (DDAVP)
     * For some mild hemophilia types.
     * Stimulates endogenous factor release.
     * IV or intranasal.
   - Emicizumab (Hemlibra)
     * Non–clotting factor biologic.
     * Prevents bleeding in hemophilia A.
   - Clot-preserving medications (antifibrinolytics)
     * Help prevent breakdown of clots.
   - Fibrin sealants
     * Applied directly to wound sites (esp. dental work).

4. Supportive care
   - Physical therapy
     * For joint damage from prior bleeding.
     * Aim to preserve mobility; surgery if joints severely damaged.
   - First aid for minor bleeding
     * Direct pressure and bandage.
     * Ice for small subcutaneous bleeds.
     * Ice pops for minor oral bleeding.

5. Long-term goals
   - Prevent spontaneous and procedure-related bleeding.
   - Protect joints and function.
   - Enable home-based prophylaxis when possible.
