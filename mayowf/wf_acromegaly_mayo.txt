ACROMEGALY TREATMENT WORKFLOW (from Mayo Clinic-based plan)

1. Core treatment goals
   - Normalize GH and IGF‑1 levels.
   - Reduce symptoms and prevent long-term complications.
   - Treat comorbidities: diabetes, sleep apnea, heart disease.

2. First-line: Pituitary tumor surgery
   - Transsphenoidal surgery through nose and sphenoid sinus.
   - Best outcomes when tumor is small.
   - Relieves GH excess and reduces pressure on nearby structures.
   - If residual tumor or incomplete removal → add medicines or repeat surgery.

3. Medical therapy
   3.1 Somatostatin analogues
       - Octreotide, lanreotide, or Mycapssa (oral octreotide).
       - New (2025): paltusotine (oral small-molecule somatostatin agonist).
       - Lower GH & IGF‑1; may shrink tumor.
   3.2 Dopamine agonists
       - Cabergoline, bromocriptine.
       - Used when GH/IGF‑1 only mildly elevated.
   3.3 GH receptor antagonist
       - Pegvisomant daily injection.
       - Blocks GH effects; normalizes IGF‑1 but does not shrink tumor.

4. Radiation therapy
   - Used when surgery incomplete or medications insufficient.
   - Types:
       * Stereotactic radiosurgery (Gamma Knife) — precise, single dose.
       * Proton beam — less pituitary damage risk.
       * Conventional radiation — small doses for 4–6 weeks; full effect may take years.
   - Requires lifelong hormone monitoring due to pituitary suppression risk.

5. Prognosis
   - Life expectancy near normal with modern therapy.
   - Early treatment + controlled hormone levels → best outcomes.
   - Bone enlargement often irreversible, but soft tissue swelling improves.

6. Long-term follow-up
   - Regular GH/IGF‑1 testing.
   - Periodic MRI for tumor recurrence.
   - Monitor for pituitary hormone deficiencies, sleep apnea, cardiovascular disease.
