TETANUS TREATMENT WORKFLOW (from Mayo Clinic-based plan)

1. Care setting and course
   - Emergency and ICU-level supportive care.
   - Disease usually progresses ~2 weeks; recovery ~1 month.

2. Wound care
   - Thorough cleaning to remove dirt, foreign bodies, and dead tissue.
   - Reduce bacterial load at infection site.

3. Pharmacologic treatment
   - Antitoxin (human tetanus immune globulin):
       * Passive immunization; neutralizes circulating toxin not yet bound to nerves.
   - Sedatives:
       * Reduce CNS activity and control muscle spasms.
   - Vaccination:
       * Standard tetanus vaccine to stimulate active immunity.
   - Antibiotics:
       * Oral or injectable agents to kill Clostridium tetani.
   - Other drugs:
       * Agents to stabilize autonomic function (heartbeat, breathing).
       * Morphine for sedation and additional autonomic control.

4. Supportive therapies
   - Airway and breathing:
       * Airway protection and respiratory support (e.g., ventilation as needed).
   - Nutrition:
       * Feeding tube into stomach to maintain caloric intake.
   - Environmental control:
       * Quiet, low-stimulus setting to minimize spasm triggers.

5. Goals
   - Maintain life-sustaining functions while toxin effect resolves.
   - Prevent complications from spasms, autonomic instability, and immobility.
