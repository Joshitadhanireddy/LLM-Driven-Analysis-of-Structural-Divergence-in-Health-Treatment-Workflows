TYPE 2 DIABETES MANAGEMENT WORKFLOW (from Mayo Clinic-based plan)

1. Core components
   - Diabetes education.
   - Healthy eating.
   - Regular physical activity.
   - Weight loss if needed.
   - Glucose monitoring.
   - Medications ± insulin as required.

2. Nutrition management
   - Emphasize:
       * Regular meal schedule and healthy snacks.
       * Smaller portions and fewer total calories.
       * High-fibre foods: fruits, nonstarchy vegetables, whole grains.
       * Lean proteins and low-fat dairy.
       * Healthy fats (olive, canola oil).
   - Limit:
       * Refined grains, starchy vegetables, sweets.
   - Dietitian support:
       * Individualized plans, carb counting, habit change coaching.

3. Physical activity
   - Aerobic exercise: ≥150 minutes/week moderate activity (e.g., walking, swimming).
   - Strength training: ≥2 sessions/week for all major muscle groups.
   - Reduce sitting time: brief light activity every ~30 minutes.

4. Weight management
   - Initial target: ≥5% body weight loss (greater loss gives more benefit).
   - Structured goals and lifestyle changes supported by care team.

5. Glucose monitoring
   - Self-monitoring frequency guided by treatment plan.
   - Options:
       * Fingerstick meter.
       * Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) with mobile alerts.
   - Keep logs for dose and lifestyle adjustment.

6. Oral and injectable medications
   6.1 First-line
       - Metformin: reduces hepatic glucose output and improves insulin sensitivity.
   6.2 Insulin secretagogues
       - Sulfonylureas: glipizide, glimepiride, glyburide.
       - Glinides: repaglinide, nateglinide.
   6.3 Insulin sensitizers
       - Thiazolidinediones: pioglitazone, rosiglitazone.
   6.4 Incretin-based & enzyme therapies
       - DPP-4 inhibitors: sitagliptin, saxagliptin, linagliptin, alogliptin.
       - GLP-1 receptor agonists (injectable): dulaglutide, exenatide, liraglutide, semaglutide.
   6.5 SGLT2 inhibitors
       - Canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin.
       - Promote urinary glucose excretion; provide CV benefits but have specific risks.
   6.6 Additional therapies
       - BP- and lipid-lowering meds.
       - Low-dose aspirin in selected high-risk patients.

7. Insulin therapy
   - Start when lifestyle + oral/injectable meds insufficient.
   - Use long-acting basal insulin ± short-acting mealtime doses.
   - Adjust regimen based on CGM or fingerstick patterns.
   - Educate on hypoglycemia recognition and rapid treatment.

8. Weight-loss (bariatric) surgery
   - Consider for BMI ≥35 (or sometimes slightly lower) with difficult-to-control diabetes.
   - Requires lifelong changes and nutritional monitoring.

9. Special situation: pregnancy with type 2 diabetes
   - Adjust diet and switch to pregnancy-safe medications.
   - Insulin usually needed.
   - Frequent eye exams for diabetic retinopathy during and after pregnancy.

10. Recognizing emergencies
   - Hyperglycemia and HHNS (BG >600 mg/dL).
   - Diabetic ketoacidosis: abdominal pain, vomiting, rapid breathing, fruity breath.
   - Hypoglycemia: sweating, tremor, confusion, drowsiness → treat with fast-acting carbs.
