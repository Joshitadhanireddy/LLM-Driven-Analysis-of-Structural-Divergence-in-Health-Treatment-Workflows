MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS) MANAGEMENT WORKFLOW (from Mayo Clinic-based plan)

1. Treatment goals
   - Speed recovery from relapses.
   - Reduce relapse rate.
   - Slow disease progression.
   - Manage symptoms.

2. Management of acute relapses
   - High-dose corticosteroids:
     * Oral prednisone or IV methylprednisolone.
   - Plasma exchange (plasmapheresis):
     * For severe, steroid-refractory relapses.

3. Disease-modifying therapies (relapsing forms)
   3.1 Injectable agents
       - Interferon beta preparations.
       - Glatiramer acetate.
       - Ofatumumab (subcutaneous anti-B-cell).
   3.2 Oral agents
       - Teriflunomide.
       - Dimethyl fumarate, diroximel fumarate, monomethyl fumarate.
       - S1P modulators: fingolimod, siponimod, ozanimod, ponesimod.
       - Cladribine (second-line, pulsed courses).
   3.3 Infusion therapies
       - Natalizumab.
       - Ocrelizumab (also for primary-progressive MS).
       - Ublituximab.
       - Alemtuzumab (for aggressive or refractory disease).

4. Symptom-directed therapies
   - Physical/occupational therapy:
     * Strength, stretch, mobility aids.
   - Muscle relaxants:
     * Baclofen, tizanidine, cyclobenzaprine, botulinum toxin.
   - Fatigue:
     * Amantadine, modafinil, methylphenidate, selected antidepressants.
   - Gait:
     * Dalfampridine to modestly increase walking speed.
   - Additional meds for:
     * Depression, pain, bladder/bowel issues, sexual dysfunction, insomnia.

5. Emerging and experimental therapies
   - BTK inhibitors (B-cell modulation).
   - Stem cell transplantation to “reset” immune system.
   - CD40L-targeted therapies.
   - New phosphodiesterase inhibitors and other immunomodulators.

6. Long-term management
   - Regular MRI and clinical review.
   - Adjust DMT according to activity, side effects, and life plans (e.g., pregnancy).
