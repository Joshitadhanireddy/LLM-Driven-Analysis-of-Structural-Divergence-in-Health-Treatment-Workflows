PROGERIA (HGPS) MANAGEMENT WORKFLOW (from Mayo Clinic-based plan)

1. Ongoing monitoring
   - Regular growth tracking (height, weight curves).
   - Periodic:
       * ECG and echocardiogram.
       * Imaging (X-ray, MRI) as indicated.
       * Vision, hearing, and dental examinations.

2. Core pharmacologic therapy
   - Lonafarnib (Zokinvy):
       * Oral FTI approved for children ≥1 year.
       * Slows progression and can extend lifespan by reducing progerin buildup.
   - Low-dose aspirin:
       * Daily prophylaxis against heart attack and stroke.

3. Management of cardiovascular and systemic complications
   - Additional medications based on condition:
       * Statins and dietary therapy to support vascular and cardiac function.
       * Anticoagulants/antiplatelets for clot prevention where indicated.
       * Symptomatic meds for headaches and other issues.

4. Rehabilitation and functional support
   - Physical therapy:
       * Maintain mobility, reduce joint stiffness, manage hip problems.
   - Occupational therapy:
       * Train adaptations for dressing, feeding, dental care, and self-care tasks.

5. Supportive care
   - Nutrition:
       * High-calorie, balanced diet; supplements if needed.
   - Hearing aids for low-frequency hearing loss when it affects function.
   - Eye care:
       * Moisturizing drops/ointments for incomplete lid closure and dry eye risk.
   - Dental care:
       * Regular visits with paediatric dentist familiar with progeria.

6. Future directions (research)
   - Improved understanding of genetic course and vascular disease.
   - Testing additional medicines and strategies to prevent heart and vessel damage.
