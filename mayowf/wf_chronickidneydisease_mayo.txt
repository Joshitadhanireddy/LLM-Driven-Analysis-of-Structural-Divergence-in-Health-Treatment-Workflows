CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE (CKD) MANAGEMENT WORKFLOW (from Mayo Clinic-based plan)

1. Treat underlying cause
   - Diabetes, hypertension, glomerulonephritis, etc.
   - Disease may progress even after cause controlled.

2. Manage CKD complications
   - Hypertension:
       * ACE inhibitors or ARBs.
       * Monitor kidney function & electrolytes.
       * Salt restriction; possible diuretics.
   - Fluid retention:
       * Diuretics for leg edema or hypertension.
   - Anemia:
       * Erythropoietin + iron supplementation.
   - Dyslipidemia:
       * Statins to lower cardiovascular risk.
   - Bone/mineral disease:
       * Calcium, vitamin D, phosphate binders.
   - Protein restriction:
       * Helps reduce nitrogenous waste burden.

3. Monitoring
   - Regular follow-up labs for progression.

4. End-stage kidney disease
   - Dialysis options:
       * Hemodialysis.
       * Peritoneal dialysis.
   - Kidney transplant:
       * From living or deceased donor.
       * Lifelong immunosuppression required.
   - Conservative care if no dialysis/transplant:
       * Symptom management + palliative care.
