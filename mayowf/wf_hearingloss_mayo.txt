HEARING LOSS MANAGEMENT WORKFLOW (from Mayo Clinic-based plan)

1. Initial evaluation
   - Determine type and severity of hearing loss.
   - Identify reversible vs. irreversible causes.

2. Reversible / mechanical causes
   - Earwax blockage:
       * Remove with suction or curette by clinician.
   - Recurrent middle-ear infections with effusion:
       * Consider tympanostomy tubes to improve drainage.

3. Surgical options
   - Selected conductive or mixed hearing losses may benefit from corrective surgery.
   - ENT specialist evaluates specific structural problems.

4. Hearing aids (sensorineural loss)
   - Primary treatment for inner-ear–related hearing loss.
   - Audiologist:
       * Explains device types and expectations.
       * Performs fitting and adjustment.

5. Cochlear implants (severe/profound loss)
   - Consider when conventional hearing aids give limited benefit.
   - Device bypasses damaged inner ear to directly stimulate auditory nerve.
   - ENT + audiologist discuss risks, benefits, and candidacy.

6. Long-term goals
   - Improve communication and quality of life.
   - Provide ongoing device adjustment, counselling, and hearing rehabilitation.
