POLYCYSTIC OVARY SYNDROME (PCOS) MANAGEMENT WORKFLOW (from Mayo Clinic-based plan)

1. Overall principle
   - Tailor treatment to main concerns:
     * Infertility, hirsutism, acne, obesity, irregular menses.

2. Lifestyle interventions
   - Weight loss via low-calorie diet + moderate exercise.
   - Aim for ≥5% weight reduction:
     * Improves symptoms, fertility, and medication response.
   - Work with clinician + dietitian for individualized plan.

3. Menstrual regulation and endometrial protection
   - Combination birth control pills:
     * Lower androgens, regulate estrogen.
     * Treat irregular bleeding, excess hair, acne.
     * Reduce endometrial cancer risk.
   - Progestin therapy:
     * 10–14 days every 1–2 months.

   - Progestin-only options:
     * Minipill or IUD if contraception also desired.

4. Ovulation induction (fertility)
   - Clomiphene: taken early in cycle.
   - Letrozole: off-label ovulation induction agent.
   - Metformin:
     * Improves insulin resistance.
     * Added if clomiphene alone fails; also helps prediabetes and weight.
   - Gonadotropin injections if oral agents insufficient.
   - Consider IVF or other procedures if needed.

5. Treatment of hirsutism and acne
