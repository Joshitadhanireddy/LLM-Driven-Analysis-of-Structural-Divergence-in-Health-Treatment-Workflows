CATARACTS TREATMENT WORKFLOW (from Mayo Clinic-based plan)

1. Indications for surgery
   - Only effective treatment for cataracts.
   - Consider surgery when vision affects daily activities (reading, night driving).
   - Faster worsening in diabetes, hypertension, obesity → may consider earlier.

2. Monitoring (if delaying surgery)
   - Regular follow-up exams to monitor progression.
   - No harm in waiting unless rapid worsening.

3. Surgical procedure
   - Outpatient surgery; local anesthesia.
   - Remove clouded lens → replace with intraocular lens (IOL).
   - If IOL not possible → vision correction with glasses/contacts.

4. Risks
   - Infection, bleeding, retinal detachment.
   - Post-op soreness; healing in weeks.

5. Bilateral cataracts
   - Second eye operated after first eye heals.
