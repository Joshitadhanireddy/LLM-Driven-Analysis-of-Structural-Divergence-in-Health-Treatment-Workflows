CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME TREATMENT WORKFLOW (from Mayo Clinic-based plan)

1. Early self-care (mild, recent-onset CTS)
   - Rest hands more often; avoid provoking activities.
   - Use cold packs to reduce swelling.
   - Seek medical care if numbness or persistent symptoms develop.

2. Nonsurgical therapy (first-line in mild–moderate CTS < ~10 months)
   2.1 Wrist splinting
       - Night splint to keep wrist neutral and reduce nocturnal numbness/tingling.
       - Often preferred in pregnancy (drug-free).
   2.2 NSAIDs
       - Short-term ibuprofen or similar for pain relief.
       - Do NOT modify disease course.
   2.3 Corticosteroid injection
       - Local cortisone injection into carpal tunnel ± ultrasound guidance.
       - Reduces inflammation and relieves pressure on median nerve.
       - Oral steroids less effective than injection.

3. Treat underlying inflammatory disease
   - If CTS is secondary to RA or other inflammatory arthritis, treat that disease.
   - May reduce CTS symptoms (evidence not definitive).

4. Indications for surgery
   - Severe CTS or failure of conservative therapy.
   - Goal: cut the transverse carpal ligament to decompress median nerve.

5. Surgical options
   - Endoscopic carpal tunnel release:
       * Endoscope introduced via 1–2 small incisions.
       * May cause less early postoperative pain.
   - Open carpal tunnel release:
       * Single incision in palm; ligament cut under direct vision.
   - Ultrasound-guided release:
       * Ultrasound visualization of nerve, tendons, vessels, ligament.
       * Ligament cut via small knife or braided wire.

6. Postoperative recovery
   - Internal ligament healing over several months; skin heals in weeks.
   - Gradual return to hand use; avoid forceful motions/extreme wrist positions early.
   - Soreness/weakness may last weeks–months; severe pre-op CTS may not fully resolve.
