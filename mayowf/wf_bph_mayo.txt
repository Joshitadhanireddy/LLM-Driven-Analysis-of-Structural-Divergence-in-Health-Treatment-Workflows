BENIGN PROSTATIC HYPERPLASIA (BPH) MANAGEMENT WORKFLOW (from Mayo Clinic-based plan)

1. Initial evaluation
   - Assess prostate size, symptom severity, age, comorbidities.
   - If symptoms mild and not bothersome → watchful waiting.

2. Medication therapy (most common first-line)
   2.1 Alpha blockers
       - Alfuzosin, doxazosin, tamsulosin, silodosin, terazosin.
       - Rapid relief; main side effects: dizziness, retrograde ejaculation.
   2.2 5‑alpha reductase inhibitors
       - Finasteride, dutasteride.
       - Shrink prostate; take months to work.
       - Sexual side effects possible.
   2.3 Combination therapy
       - Alpha blocker + 5‑ARI for insufficient response.
   2.4 Tadalafil
       - Helps both erectile dysfunction and BPH symptoms.

3. Surgical & procedural options
   - TURP → rapid symptom improvement; may require catheter post‑op.
   - TUIP → for smaller prostates.
   - TUMT → microwave therapy (used less; benefits small).
   - Laser therapy:
       * PVP, HoLAP, HoLEP (removes tissue; fewer complications).
   - Prostate lift (UroLift) → fewer sexual side effects.
   - WVTT (water vapor thermal therapy).
   - Robotic waterjet ablation.
   - Open or robotic prostatectomy → very large prostates.
   - Prostate artery embolization (PAE) → in trained interventional radiology centers.

4. Follow-up
   - Activity restrictions vary by procedure.
   - Monitor urinary symptoms, sexual side effects, infections.
