ASTHMA MANAGEMENT WORKFLOW (from Mayo Clinic-based plan)

1. Core approach
   - Prevent attacks, manage triggers, track symptoms.
   - Use long-term controllers + quick-relief inhalers as needed.

2. Long-term control medications (daily)
   - Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS): fluticasone, budesonide, ciclesonide, beclomethasone, mometasone.
   - Leukotriene modifiers: montelukast, zafirlukast, zileuton.
     * Montelukast linked to neuropsychiatric effects; monitor mood.
   - Combination ICS/LABA inhalers: Advair, Symbicort, Dulera, Breo.
   - Theophylline: rarely used; requires blood‑level monitoring.

3. Quick-relief (rescue) medications
   - Short-acting beta agonists (SABA): albuterol, levalbuterol.
   - Anticholinergics: ipratropium, tiotropium.
   - Oral/IV steroids (prednisone, methylprednisolone) for severe attacks only.

4. Allergy-driven asthma
   - Allergy shots (immunotherapy).
   - Biologics for severe asthma:
       * Omalizumab, mepolizumab, dupilumab, reslizumab, benralizumab, tezepelumab.

5. Bronchial thermoplasty (severe asthma only)
   - Reduces airway smooth muscle.
   - Performed over 3 outpatient sessions.

6. Stepwise treatment
   - Increase or decrease meds according to control level.
   - If SABA use rises → adjust controller meds.

7. Asthma action plan
   - Written plan for daily meds, exacerbation steps, triggers.
   - Peak flow monitoring for moderate–severe asthma.
