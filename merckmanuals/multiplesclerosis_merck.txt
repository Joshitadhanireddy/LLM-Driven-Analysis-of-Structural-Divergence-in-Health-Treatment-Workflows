=== Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis ===

  - Glucocorticoids for acute exacerbations

  - Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) to prevent exacerbations and delay eventual disability

  - Rehabilitative care and symptom management

Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) to prevent exacerbations and delay eventual disability

Goals for treatment of multiple sclerosis include the following:

  - Shortening acute exacerbations

  - Decreasing frequency of exacerbations

  - Relieving symptoms

  - Delaying disability, particularly maintaining the patient’s ability to walk

Delaying disability, particularly maintaining the patient’s ability to walk


--- Treatment of exacerbations and relapses ---


Glucocorticoids, given orally or intravenously in brief courses (3 to 5 days), are used to treat acute onset of symptoms or exacerbations that cause objective deficits sufficient to impair function (eg, loss of vision, strength, or coordination). Glucocorticoids may be given orally ( methylprednisolone or prednisone ) or intravenously ( methylprednisolone ). Some data indicate that oral or IV methylprednisolone have similar efficacy ( Glucocorticoids, given orally or intravenously in brief courses (3 to 5 days), are used to treat acute onset of symptoms or exacerbations that cause objective deficits sufficient to impair function (eg, loss of vision, strength, or coordination). Glucocorticoids may be given orally (methylprednisolone or prednisone) or intravenously (methylprednisolone). Some data indicate that oral or IV methylprednisolone have similar efficacy ( 1, 2 ).

Short courses of high-dose glucocorticoids, oral or intravenous, may shorten acute exacerbations, temporarily slow progression, and improve MRI measures of disease. However, glucocorticoids have not been shown to delay the progression of long-term disability in patients with MS ( 3 ).

If glucocorticoids are ineffective in reducing the severity of an exacerbation, plasma exchange may be used ( 4 ). Plasma exchange can be used for any relapsing form of MS (relapsing-remitting, progressive relapsing, secondary progressive), but is not used for primary progressive MS.

Plasma exchange and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( 5 ) may be useful for severe, intractable disease.


--- Disease-modifying therapies ---


Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) target and control the immune system, to prevent exacerbations and delay eventual disability. There are comprehensive practice guidelines for using DMTs ( 6, 7 ). For additional information on DMTs, see Practice guideline recommendations summary: Disease-modifying therapies for adults with multiple sclerosis (American Academy of Neurology 2018, reaffirmed 2024) , the National Multiple Sclerosis Society website , and updated guidelines on the use of high-efficacy therapies ( 8–11 ).

Disease-modifying therapies that treat relapsing remitting MS have been categorized as either moderately efficacious or highly efficacious based on their ability to reduce relapse rate, new MRI lesions, and disability:

  - Moderately efficacious: interferon beta 1a, interferon beta 1b, glatiramer acetate, teriflunomide , dimethyl fumurate, monomethyl fumurate, diroximel fumarate , fingolimod , siponimod , ozanimod , ponesimod interferon beta 1a, interferon beta 1b, glatiramer acetate, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumurate, monomethyl fumurate, diroximel fumarate, fingolimod, siponimod, ozanimod, ponesimod

  - Highly efficacious: natalizumab , rituximab , ocrelizumab , ofatumumab , ublituximab , cladribine , and alemtuzumab . Some experts also include fingolimod , siponimod , ozanimod , ponesimod in this category. natalizumab, rituximab, ocrelizumab, ofatumumab, ublituximab, cladribine, and alemtuzumab. Some experts also include fingolimod, siponimod, ozanimod, ponesimod in this category.

Some experts also include fingolimod, siponimod, ozanimod, ponesimod in this category.

Many of the DMTs are also approved for clinically isolated syndrome and active secondary progressive MS.

The following moderately efficacious disease-modifying therapies are injectable and self-administered:

  - Interferon beta-1a 

  - Interferon beta-1b 

  - Glatiramer acetate 

The following oral immunomodulatory medications, grouped by efficacy, can be used to treat relapsing forms of MS, including active secondary MS (patients transitioning from relapsing remitting MS into secondary progressive MS, but still showing active disease).

  - Teriflunomide 

  - Dimethyl fumarate 

  - Monomethyl fumarate 

  - Diroximel fumarate Moderate efficacy (though some consider high efficacy):

  - Fingolimod 

  - Siponimod 

  - Ozanimod 

  - Ponesimod High efficacy:

  - Cladribine 

Moderate efficacy (though some consider high efficacy):

There is growing consensus regarding using high-efficacy therapies as first line when initiating treatment. If a patient is already on a disease-modifying therapy, many experts continue this treatment (even if not identified as "high efficacy") until there is evidence of disease worsening, such as a new relapse, new MRI lesion, or worsening disability. Treatment plans, including when to initiate disease-modifying therapy, are best decided with patient education and shared decision making between patients and physicians. If one medication is ineffective, a different one can be tried. Treatments should be tailored to the patient and managed by MS specialists.

Since monoclonal antibodies for MS treatment have become available, the immunosuppressant mitoxantrone is used less often but may still be helpful, particularly for progressive MS that is refractory to other treatments. Since monoclonal antibodies for MS treatment have become available, the immunosuppressant mitoxantrone is used less often but may still be helpful, particularly for progressive MS that is refractory to other treatments.

Natalizumab , an anti–alpha-4 integrin antibody, inhibits passage of leukocytes across the blood-brain barrier; given as a monthly infusion, it reduces number of exacerbations and new brain lesions but may increase the risk of Natalizumab, an anti–alpha-4 integrin antibody, inhibits passage of leukocytes across the blood-brain barrier; given as a monthly infusion, it reduces number of exacerbations and new brain lesions but may increase the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Symptoms of PML include aphasia, change in mental status, hemianopia, and ataxia.

Medications that increase the risk of PML include the following (in descending order of risk):

  - Natalizumab 

  - Fingolimod 

  - Siponimod 

  - Rituximab 

  - Ocrelizumab 

  - Ofatumumab 

  - Rarely, dimethyl fumarate 

Rarely, dimethyl fumarate Rarely, dimethyl fumarate

Consultation with a neurologist with training in MS is highly recommended before using any of these medications. Prior to starting disease-modifying therapies, blood tests should be done to check for antibodies to JC virus (Jakob-Creutzfeldt virus, JCV), which causes PML. Based on the results, one of the following is done:

  - If results are positive, patients should be counseled about the risk of PML.

  - If results are negative, antibody tests should be done every 6 months as long as any of these medications is used; seroconversion is common.

  - If test results become positive, patients should be counseled again about the risk, and clinicians should consider switching to a medication without PML risk.

If results are positive, patients should be counseled about the risk of PML.

If results are negative, antibody tests should be done every 6 months as long as any of these medications is used; seroconversion is common.

If test results become positive, patients should be counseled again about the risk, and clinicians should consider switching to a medication without PML risk.

If the high-risk medication is continued, MRI of the brain should be done about every 6 months.

Development of PML symptoms requires immediate brain MRI, with and without gadolinium. MRI can often distinguish PML from MS. After MRI, a lumbar puncture should be done, and cerebrospinal fluid should be tested for JCV DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A positive result indicates PML, and emergency consultation with a neurologist and an infectious disease specialist is needed. If patients with a positive result have taken natalizumab , should be done, and cerebrospinal fluid should be tested for JCV DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A positive result indicates PML, and emergency consultation with a neurologist and an infectious disease specialist is needed. If patients with a positive result have taken natalizumab, plasma exchange can be done to remove the medication quickly, and if immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) develops, glucocorticoids are given.

--- Rehabilitative care and symptom management ---


Patients with multiple sclerosis are helped by encouragement and reassurance from their care providers.

Physical, occupational, and speech therapists should be consulted as needed and be integrated into the care plan of an individual patient. Regular exercise (eg, stationary biking, treadmill, swimming, stretching, balance exercises), with or without physical therapy, is recommended, even for patients with advanced MS. Exercise conditions the heart and muscles, reduces spasticity, prevents contractures and falls, and has psychological benefits.

Vitamin D supplements (eg, 600 to 4000 IU/day to achieve blood levels of 20 to 50 ng/mL [50 to 125 nmol/L]) are generally recommended based on mixed evidence that they may delay the risk of disease progression; however, this effect has not been consistently shown in clinical trials ( Vitamin D supplements (eg, 600 to 4000 IU/day to achieve blood levels of 20 to 50 ng/mL [50 to 125 nmol/L]) are generally recommended based on mixed evidence that they may delay the risk of disease progression; however, this effect has not been consistently shown in clinical trials ( 16–18 ). Serum vitamin D levels should be monitored to make sure that dosing is adequate. Vitamin D also reduces the risk of osteoporosis, particularly in patients at increased risk because of decreased mobility or glucocorticoid therapy. levels should be monitored to make sure that dosing is adequate. Vitamin D also reduces the risk of osteoporosis, particularly in patients at increased risk because of decreased mobility or glucocorticoid therapy.

Patients should maintain as normal and active a life as possible but should avoid overwork, fatigue, and exposure to excess heat. Cigarette smoking or other nicotine ingestions should be stopped. Patients should maintain as normal and active a life as possible but should avoid overwork, fatigue, and exposure to excess heat. Cigarette smoking or other nicotine ingestions should be stopped.

Vaccination does not appear to increase risk of exacerbations.

Debilitated patients require measures to prevent pressure ulcers and urinary tract infections ; intermittent urinary self-catheterization may be necessary.
