=== Treatment of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome ===

  - Splinting

  - Treatment of underlying disorders

  - Sometimes corticosteroid/anesthetic injection

  - Sometimes surgical decompression

Changing the position of computer keyboards and making other ergonomic corrections may occasionally provide relief. Otherwise, treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome includes wearing a lightweight neutral wrist splint, especially at night, and taking mild analgesics (eg, acetaminophen , nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs).

Treating any underlying disorders (eg, diabetes , rheumatoid arthritis , hypothyroidism ) may help relieve symptoms.

If these measures do not control symptoms, treatment options are management with surgical decompression or injection of a glucocorticoid. Symptom recovery is significantly better with initial surgical treatment regardless of symptom severity, and nearly half of patients treated with injection therapy went on to have surgery in a large trial ( 1 ). However, some patients may prefer an initial injection approach. Surgery involves decompression of the median nerve at the carpal tunnel using an open or endoscopic technique. For steroid injection, a mixture of an anesthetic and a glucocorticoid (eg, 1.5 mL of a 4-mg/mL dexamethasone solution mixed with 1.5 mL of 1% lidocaine ) is injected into the carpal tunnel at a site just ulnar to the palmaris longus tendon and proximal to the distal crease at the wrist. This is more often effective for milder or pregnancy-related carpal tunnel syndrome. ). However, some patients may prefer an initial injection approach.
