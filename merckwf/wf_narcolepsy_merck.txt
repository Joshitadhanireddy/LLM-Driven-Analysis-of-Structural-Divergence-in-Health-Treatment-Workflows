NARCOLEPSY TREATMENT WORKFLOW (from Merck-based plan)

1. Non-drug foundation
   - Ensure adequate nocturnal sleep.
   - Schedule brief daytime naps (<30 minutes), ideally at consistent times.
   - Avoid triggers of cataplexy (e.g., intense laughter, anger, fear) when possible.

2. Type 1 narcolepsy (with cataplexy)
   - First-line for cataplexy: oxybates or pitolisant.
   - If excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) persists:
     * Add modafinil (or armodafinil) as a wake-promoting agent.

3. Type 2 narcolepsy (without cataplexy)
   - First-line for EDS: modafinil.
   - Second-line: solriamfetol if EDS not controlled.
   - Pitolisant can also be used for EDS.

4. Wake-promoting agents
   - Modafinil / armodafinil:
     * Morning dosing (± small midday dose for modafinil).
     * Monitor for headache, nausea, rare severe rash; avoid in pregnancy.
   - Solriamfetol:
     * Norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor; adjust dose for renal impairment.
   - Pitolisant:
     * Histamine-3 inverse agonist; adjust for renal/hepatic disease; monitor QT interval.

5. Oxybates
   - Night-time medication (one or two doses per night depending on formulation).
   - Improves both cataplexy and EDS.
   - Monitor for adverse effects (nausea, dizziness, enuresis, sleepwalking) and abuse potential.

6. Other agents
   - Consider SSRIs or tricyclic antidepressants only if pitolisant/oxybates are ineffective for cataplexy and REM phenomena.
   - Traditional stimulants (methylphenidate, amphetamines) are later-line options after modafinil, armodafinil, solriamfetol, and pitolisant, with careful cardiovascular screening in older patients.

7. Safety and follow-up
   - Counsel on driving, workplace safety, and contraception interactions with some drugs.
   - Regularly reassess symptom control, side effects, and comorbid sleep or mood disorders.
