ATOPIC DERMATITIS (ECZEMA) TREATMENT WORKFLOW (from Merck-based plan)

1. Supportive care & trigger control
   - Limit bathing to once daily; lukewarm water; pat dry.
   - Avoid harsh soaps and excessive rubbing.
   - Liberal use of moisturizers (ointments/creams, ceramide‑containing preferred).
   - Short nails; manage stress; avoid unnecessary elimination diets.
   - For suspected superinfection: diluted bleach baths.

2. Itch control
   - Sedating oral antihistamines (eg, hydroxyzine, diphenhydramine) at night.
   - Non‑sedating antihistamines may help some patients.

3. Topical anti‑inflammatory therapy
   - Topical corticosteroids twice daily:
     * Low‑/mid‑potency for most flares; high‑potency for lichenified skin with time/area limits.
   - Avoid prolonged widespread high‑potency use (skin atrophy, adrenal suppression).
   - Stop steroids once inflammation controlled; do not use continuously to prevent flares.

4. Steroid‑sparing topical agents
   - Calcineurin inhibitors: tacrolimus, pimecrolimus (BID) for sensitive areas or steroid‑sparing.
   - Crisaborole 2% ointment (PDE‑4 inhibitor) for mild–moderate disease.
   - Topical JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib for short‑term, non‑continuous use on limited BSA.

5. Phototherapy
   - Narrow‑band UVB for extensive disease not controlled with optimized topicals.
   - Consider home phototherapy if office access difficult; balance benefit vs theoretical cancer risk.

6. Systemic therapy for moderate–severe, refractory disease
   - Conventional immunosuppressants: cyclosporine, methotrexate, mycophenolate, azathioprine.
   - Biologics: dupilumab, tralokinumab (first‑line systemic for many moderate–severe cases).
   - Oral JAK inhibitors (upadacitinib, abrocitinib, baricitinib) with careful risk–benefit assessment.

7. Infection management
   - Topical/oral antistaphylococcal antibiotics for impetigo/folliculitis/furunculosis; culture for MRSA.
   - Nasal mupirocin for staph carriers with recurrent infection.
   - Eczema herpeticum: systemic antivirals; urgent ophthalmology if eye involvement.

8. Follow‑up
   - Step therapy up or down based on control.
   - Reinforce skin‑care routine and adherence at each visit.
