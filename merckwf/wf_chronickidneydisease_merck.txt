CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE (CKD) TREATMENT WORKFLOW (from Merck-based plan)

1. Control underlying cause and comorbidities
   - Tight control of diabetes and hypertension to slow GFR decline.
   - Use ACE inhibitors or ARBs for most CKD with proteinuria (avoid combined ACEi + ARB).
   - Consider SGLT2 inhibitors for proteinuric CKD (with or without diabetes).
   - Add finerenone (NSMRA) in T2DM with albuminuric CKD despite ACE/ARB + SGLT2, if eGFR >25 and no hyperkalemia.

2. Nutrition and fluid management
   - Moderate protein restriction (~0.8 g/kg/day) once eGFR <60; stricter restriction only with dietitian supervision.
   - Limit sodium to <2 g/day, especially with volume overload or hypertension.
   - Restrict phosphate and use phosphate binders if hyperphosphatemic.
   - Individualize potassium restriction based on serum K, eGFR, and meds.
   - Treat metabolic acidosis: oral sodium bicarbonate or alkaline-ash diet to keep serum HCO₃⁻ >18 mmol/L.

3. Mineral and bone disorder management
   - Monitor Ca, phosphate, PTH, vitamin D, alkaline phosphatase from CKD stage 3a.
   - Dietary phosphate restriction + binders (calcium or non–calcium) as needed.
   - Correct vitamin D deficiency with cholecalciferol/ergocalciferol.
   - If PTH remains markedly elevated despite correction of phosphate and vitamin D → consider active vitamin D analog or calcimimetic.

4. Anemia management
   - Treat when Hb <10 g/dL with ESAs (epoetin alfa, etc.) using lowest dose to keep Hb ~10–11 g/dL.
   - Replace iron (often IV) to keep TSAT >20% and ferritin >100 ng/mL in non-dialysis CKD.
   - Reserve transfusion for severe or symptomatic anemia (e.g., Hb <8 g/dL).

5. Cardiovascular and heart failure management
   - Sodium restriction, diuretics, and standard HF medications (ACE/ARB, beta-blockers, aldosterone antagonists, SGLT2i) with dose adjustments for CKD.
   - Careful combination of loop + thiazide diuretics if needed, with monitoring.

6. Medication dosing and avoidance
   - Adjust doses for renally cleared drugs (e.g., many antibiotics, digoxin).
   - Avoid or minimize NSAIDs and other nephrotoxic agents.
   - Avoid certain drugs when eGFR <60 (e.g., nitrofurantoin, phenazopyridine).

7. Dialysis planning and initiation
   - Begin preparation for dialysis, transplant, or conservative care in early–mid stage 4 CKD.
   - Start dialysis for uremic symptoms or when fluid overload, hyperkalemia, or acidosis cannot be controlled medically.
   - Typical GFR threshold: ≤10 mL/min (no diabetes) or ≤15 mL/min (with diabetes).

8. Transplantation
   - Refer early for transplant evaluation.
   - Living donor transplant before dialysis yields best outcomes.
