ACROMEGALY TREATMENT WORKFLOW (from Merck-based plan)

1. First-line: Pituitary tumor surgery
   - Selective removal of pituitary adenoma (transsphenoidal).
   - Assess cure: normalize GH after glucose load + IGF‑1 levels.
   - If labs still abnormal → add medical therapy and/or radiation.

2. Medical therapy indications
   - Surgery contraindicated OR
   - Residual/unresectable tumor OR
   - While waiting for radiation effect.

3. Medical options
   - Somatostatin receptor ligands (SRLs)
     * Octreotide (IM, or oral), lanreotide (deep SC) – monthly; may extend interval if well controlled.
     * Pasireotide if octreotide/lanreotide inadequate.
   - Dopamine agonist
     * Cabergoline for mild disease, often combined with SRL.
   - GH receptor antagonist
     * Pegvisomant daily SC; normalizes IGF‑1 and symptoms but does not shrink tumor.

4. Radiation therapy
   - Stereotactic radiation (~5000 cGy) or proton beam (higher dose, fewer centers).
   - Typically reserved for persistent disease or when surgery/meds not feasible.
   - GH may take years to normalize; hypopituitarism common long‑term.

5. Long-term follow-up
   - Lifelong monitoring of GH/IGF‑1, pituitary function, and tumor size.
   - Manage comorbidities: hypertension, heart failure, diabetes, sleep apnea.
