POLYCYSTIC OVARY SYNDROME (PCOS) TREATMENT WORKFLOW (from Merck-based plan)

1. Core treatment goals
   - Normalize endometrial shedding and reduce estrogen-related cancer risk.
   - Improve metabolic profile and insulin sensitivity.
   - Manage acne, hirsutism, and menstrual irregularity.
   - Support fertility when pregnancy is desired.
   - Address psychological and cardiometabolic comorbidities.

2. Cycle and endometrial protection
   - First-line: combined estrogen–progestin contraceptives (pill/patch/ring):
     * Regulate menses, reduce circulating androgens, improve acne and hirsutism.
   - Alternatives when estrogen not suitable:
     * Cyclic oral progestins every 1–2 months.
     * Levonorgestrel IUD for local progestin effect.
   - Prefer progestins with antiandrogenic properties (e.g., drospirenone, dienogest) when appropriate.

3. Metabolic management
   - Lifestyle: weight loss and regular exercise for patients with overweight/obesity.
   - Metformin (500–1000 mg twice daily):
     * Improves insulin sensitivity, metabolic markers, and cycle regularity.
     * Minimal direct effect on hirsutism/acne/infertility; consider contraception if pregnancy not desired.
   - Investigational/adjunct:
     * GLP-1 receptor agonists or TZDs with metformin for obesity/insulin resistance in selected patients.

4. Hirsutism and acne
   - Physical hair removal methods (bleaching, waxing, depilation, electrolysis, laser).
   - Topical eflornithine for facial hair.
   - Estrogen–progestin contraceptives to reduce androgen levels.
   - Antiandrogens (e.g., spironolactone) with reliable contraception due to teratogenic risk.
   - Standard acne therapies; systemic isotretinoin only for severe cases.

5. Fertility management
   - First-line ovulation induction: clomiphene.
   - Alternative/adjunct: letrozole (aromatase inhibitor), other gonadotropin-based regimens.
   - If medications fail or other indications exist: consider laparoscopic ovarian drilling (with awareness of adhesion/ovarian insufficiency risk).

6. Comorbidity screening and management
   - Screen for depression, anxiety, sleep apnea in appropriate patients.
   - Assess cardiometabolic risk: BMI, blood pressure, glucose tolerance, lipids, family history.
   - Manage cardiovascular risk factors early and consider specialist referral.
   - Evaluate abnormal uterine bleeding or chronic anovulation for endometrial hyperplasia/cancer.

7. Long-term follow-up
   - Periodic review of cycles, metabolic labs, weight, and treatment goals (fertility vs contraception).
   - Adjust therapy as reproductive goals and comorbidities evolve.
