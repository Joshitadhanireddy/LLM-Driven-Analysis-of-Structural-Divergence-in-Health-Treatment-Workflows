BELL’S PALSY (IDIOPATHIC FACIAL NERVE PALSY) TREATMENT WORKFLOW (from Merck-based plan)

1. Eye protection (critical)
   - Prevent corneal drying:
     * Frequent artificial tears / saline / methylcellulose drops.
     * Tape or patch to keep eye closed during sleep.
   - Consider tarsorrhaphy if exposure keratopathy persists.

2. Glucocorticoid therapy
   - Start oral glucocorticoids within 3 days of symptom onset.
   - Speeds and improves likelihood of full recovery.

3. Antiviral therapy
   - HSV antivirals (eg, acyclovir) provide no proven benefit when added to steroids for typical idiopathic Bell’s palsy.

4. Monitoring & rehabilitation
   - Reassure that most cases recover.
   - Consider facial physical therapy if residual weakness or synkinesis develops.
