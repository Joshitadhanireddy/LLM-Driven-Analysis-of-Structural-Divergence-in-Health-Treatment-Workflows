CHLAMYDIA (UROGENITAL) TREATMENT WORKFLOW (from Merck-based plan)

1. Core antibiotic therapy (uncomplicated infection)
   - First-line: doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days.
   - Alternatives: azithromycin 1 g orally single dose OR levofloxacin 500 mg orally once daily for 7 days.
   - In pregnancy:
     * Preferred: azithromycin 1 g orally single dose.
     * Alternative: amoxicillin 500 mg orally three times daily for 7 days.
   - Pregnant patients: test of cure at 4 weeks and retest within 3 months.

2. Gonorrhea coverage
   - Regimens above do NOT reliably treat gonorrhea.
   - Give ceftriaxone 500 mg IM single dose (1 g if ≥150 kg) unless gonorrhea has been excluded.

3. Trichomonas coverage (where prevalent)
   - Empiric treatment with metronidazole, tinidazole, or secnidazole unless NAAT is negative for trichomoniasis.

4. Partner management and sexual precautions
   - Evaluate, test, and presumptively treat sex partners within the past 60 days, or the most recent partner if last sex >60 days ago.
   - Patients and partners should avoid sexual activity until ALL have completed at least 1 week of treatment.

5. Retreatment and reinfection
   - Relapses (up to ~13% within 12 months) often represent reinfection or coinfection with other organisms.
   - Retest for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and when possible mycoplasma and trichomoniasis.
   - Consider expedited partner therapy (EPT) where legally permitted.

6. Post-exposure prophylaxis in high-risk groups
   - Doxycycline taken within 72 hours of condomless sex can reduce incidence of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis in certain high-risk populations (per CDC guidance).
