COMMON COLD TREATMENT WORKFLOW (from Merck-based plan)

1. Overall approach
   - Viral self-limited illness → treatment is symptomatic/supportive.
   - Antibiotics are NOT indicated unless clear secondary bacterial infection.

2. Symptom relief
   - Fever/sore throat: antipyretics and analgesics (e.g., acetaminophen, NSAIDs if appropriate).
   - Nasal obstruction: topical or oral decongestants.
     * Topical nasal decongestants more effective but limit use to ≤3–5 days to avoid rebound congestion.

3. Rhinorrhea management
   - First-generation antihistamines (e.g., chlorpheniramine) OR intranasal ipratropium may reduce runny nose, but benefits are modest.
   - Use caution in older adults and those with BPH or angle-closure glaucoma.
   - Second-generation (non-sedating) antihistamines are NOT effective for common cold symptoms.

4. Pediatric considerations
   - Antihistamines and decongestants are NOT recommended for children <4 years.

5. Supplements and alternative agents
   - Zinc, echinacea, and vitamin C have not shown clear benefit overall.
   - Zinc lozenges may slightly shorten cold duration but can cause bad taste and nausea.
   - Avoid intranasal zinc due to risk of permanent anosmia.

6. Follow-up
   - Reassess if high fever, dyspnea, chest pain, or persistent/worsening symptoms suggest secondary bacterial infection or another diagnosis.
