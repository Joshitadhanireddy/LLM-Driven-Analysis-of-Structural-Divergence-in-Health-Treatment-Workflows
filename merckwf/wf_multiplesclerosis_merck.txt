MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS) TREATMENT WORKFLOW (from Merck-based plan)

1. Treatment goals
   - Shorten acute relapses.
   - Reduce relapse frequency.
   - Delay disability, preserve ambulation.
   - Control symptoms and maintain quality of life.

2. Management of relapses
   - High-dose glucocorticoids for significant relapses (e.g., vision loss, motor deficit):
     * Oral or IV methylprednisolone (or prednisone) for 3–5 days.
   - If inadequate response:
     * Plasma exchange for severe, steroid-refractory relapses.
     * Consider hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in highly active, treatment-resistant disease.

3. Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs)
   - Moderately efficacious options:
     * Injectables: interferon beta-1a, interferon beta-1b, glatiramer acetate.
     * Orals: teriflunomide, dimethyl/monomethyl/diroximel fumarate, fingolimod, siponimod, ozanimod, ponesimod.
   - Highly efficacious options:
     * Monoclonal antibodies: natalizumab, ocrelizumab, ofatumumab, ublituximab, rituximab (off-label), alemtuzumab.
     * Cladribine (oral).
   - Growing consensus to use high-efficacy agents early in many patients.
   - Screen and monitor for PML risk (JCV antibodies, MRI) when using higher-risk agents.

4. Symptom-specific management
   - Spasticity: baclofen or tizanidine; add botulinum toxin for focal spasticity.
   - Gait impairment: dalfampridine (ER 4-aminopyridine).
   - Neuropathic pain: gabapentin/pregabalin; tricyclics or other antiseizure meds as alternatives.
   - Fatigue: amantadine, modafinil, armodafinil, or ER stimulants.
   - Bladder dysfunction, constipation, tremor, depression: treat per mechanism and standard guidelines.

5. Rehabilitation and lifestyle
   - Regular exercise and physical/occupational/speech therapy as needed.
   - Fall prevention, pressure-ulcer and UTI prevention in debilitated patients.
   - Vitamin D supplementation targeting adequate serum levels.
   - Avoid overheating, overexertion, and nicotine; encourage normal activity within limits.

6. Ongoing review
   - Regular neurological follow-up with MRI and functional assessment.
   - Adjust or switch DMTs if new relapses, MRI lesions, or disability progression occur.
