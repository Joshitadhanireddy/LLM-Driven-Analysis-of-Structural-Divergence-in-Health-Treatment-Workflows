HEMOPHILIA TREATMENT WORKFLOW (from Merck-based plan)

1. Immediate management of suspected bleed
   - If bleeding is suspected (e.g., headache, joint pain, trauma), treat first, investigate later.
   - Give factor replacement without waiting for imaging or labs when serious bleeding is possible.

2. Factor replacement (core therapy)
   - Hemophilia A: factor VIII concentrate (recombinant preferred; plasma-derived only if needed).
     * Target trough levels:
       - ~50%: minor procedures (e.g., dental extraction) or early joint bleed.
       - 50–80%: severe joint/muscle bleeding and post-op days after major surgery.
       - 100%: life-threatening bleeds (intracranial, cardiac, ocular) and before major surgery.
   - Hemophilia B: factor IX concentrate (recombinant or viral-inactivated).
     * Same target levels as hemophilia A, but higher doses (factor IX has wider distribution).
   - Use extended–half-life products when appropriate to reduce dosing frequency.

3. Adjunct and alternative hemostatic therapies
   - Non-factor prophylaxis for hemophilia A and/or B (with or without inhibitors):
     * Emicizumab (bispecific antibody mimicking factor VIII activity).
     * Fitusiran, concizumab, marstacimab (target natural anticoagulant pathways).
   - Antifibrinolytics (aminocaproic acid, tranexamic acid):
     * Use as adjunct for mucosal procedures (e.g., dental extraction, tongue lacerations).

4. DDAVP (desmopressin) for mild hemophilia A
   - Test response beforehand.
   - Use for minor trauma or dental work in responsive patients (baseline FVIII ≥5%).
   - Avoid in hemophilia B.

5. Backup products (only if factor concentrates unavailable)
   - Cryoprecipitate for factor VIII.
   - Fresh frozen plasma for factor VIII/IX.
   - Reserve for emergencies because they are not reliably virally inactivated.

6. Long-term prophylaxis and gene therapy
   - Regular factor or non-factor prophylaxis to prevent spontaneous bleeds and protect joints.
   - Consider AAV-based gene therapy where available to provide sustained factor VIII/IX expression.

7. Monitoring and follow-up
   - Track factor trough levels during major bleeds/surgery with planned dose adjustments.
   - Screen for inhibitors to factor VIII/IX.
   - Educate patients on early recognition of bleeds and home treatment protocols.
