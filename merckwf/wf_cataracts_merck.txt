CATARACTS TREATMENT WORKFLOW (from Merck-based plan)

1. Non-surgical visual optimization
   - Frequent refractions and updated glasses/contact lens prescriptions to maintain useful vision.
   - Use indirect lighting while reading to minimize pupillary constriction and improve near vision.
   - For small central cataracts in selected cases: long-term pupillary dilation with phenylephrine 2.5% every 4–8 hours (specialist supervised).

2. Indications for cataract surgery
   - Best corrected visual acuity worse than ~20/40 (6/12) OR
   - Vision significantly impaired under glare (halos, starbursts) and affecting daily tasks (driving, reading, work, hobbies).
   - Less common indications:
     * Cataract causing secondary glaucoma.
     * Cataract obscuring the fundus when regular fundus exam is needed (e.g., diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration).
   - Asymptomatic cataracts alone are NOT an indication for surgery.

3. Surgical management
   - Surgical removal of the cataractous lens.
   - Placement of intraocular lens (IOL) in most cases.
   - Post-op refraction once healing stabilizes to optimize visual correction.

4. Follow-up and long-term care
   - Monitor visual function and ocular pressure.
   - Continue disease-specific retinal surveillance where fundus view was previously obscured.
