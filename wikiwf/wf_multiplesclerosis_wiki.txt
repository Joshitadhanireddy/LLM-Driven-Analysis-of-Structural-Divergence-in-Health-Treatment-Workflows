MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS) MANAGEMENT WORKFLOW (from Wikipedia-based plan)

1. Diagnosis and initial strategy
   - Confirm MS type (CIS, RRMS, SPMS, PPMS) with clinical exam and MRI.
   - Initiate disease-modifying therapy (DMT) after first attack if >2 MRI lesions.
   - Goals: restore function after relapses, prevent new attacks, and delay disability.

2. Management of acute relapses
   - First-line: high-dose corticosteroids
     * IV methylprednisolone (or high-dose oral equivalent).
     * Short-term symptom improvement; limited effect on long-term recovery.
   - If severe relapse refractory to steroids:
     * Consider plasmapheresis.

3. Chronic disease-modifying treatment – Relapsing–Remitting MS (RRMS)
   3.1 First-line injectables
       - Interferon beta preparations.
       - Glatiramer acetate.
       - Reduce relapses by ~30%; safe long-term and also used after CIS.
   3.2 Newer oral/infusion agents (examples)
       - Fingolimod, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate.
       - Higher-efficacy monoclonal antibodies:
         * Natalizumab, cladribine, alemtuzumab.
         * Ublituximab (approved 2022).
       - Choice based on efficacy, side-effect profile, and patient factors.
   3.3 Monitoring
       - Regular clinical review and MRI to assess relapses and lesion burden.
       - Adjust therapy if disease remains active or side effects are problematic.

4. Progressive MS (SPMS and PPMS)
   - SPMS:
     * Mitoxantrone (first approved; moderate effect on progression and relapses).
     * Newer agents: siponimod, cladribine, ozanimod, ponesimod for active SPMS.
   - PPMS:
     * Ocrelizumab (first approved drug; reduces worsening of symptoms).
     * Ocrelizumab/hyaluronidase (subcutaneous formulation; approved 2024).
   - Balance benefits against higher risks and adverse effects.

5. Adverse effect monitoring
   - Common:
     * Injection-site reactions and lipoatrophy (interferons, glatiramer).
     * Flu-like symptoms (interferons).
     * GI upset, flushing (dimethyl fumarate).
     * Hypertension, bradycardia, macular oedema (fingolimod).
     * Hepatotoxicity (several agents).
   - Serious but rare:
     * Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) with natalizumab and some others.
     * Cardiac toxicity, infertility, and leukemia with mitoxantrone.
     * Severe liver injury and fetal toxicity with teriflunomide.
   - Implement baseline and periodic blood tests, eye exams, and infection screening as per drug label.

6. Symptom control and rehabilitation
   - Target specific symptoms:
     * Spasticity: medication + physiotherapy (exercise, electrical stimulation, vibration, standing, shock wave therapy).
     * Bladder dysfunction: catheters, medications.
     * Fatigue: cognitive behavioural therapy, graded activity.
     * Pain, mood, and cognition: pharmacological and psychological therapies.
   - Use multidisciplinary rehab (physio, OT, speech, psychology) to:
     * Improve activity and participation.
     * Provide mobility aids and environmental adaptations.

7. Complementary and alternative therapies
   - Many people use dietary supplements, vitamin D, relaxation/yoga, cannabis products, hyperbaric oxygen, acupuncture, mindfulness, etc.
   - Evidence for most is weak or absent; high-dose biotin may increase relapse risk.
   - Nabiximols (THC/CBD) can reduce short-term spasticity but may cause neurological side effects.

8. Long-term management goals
   - Minimise relapse rate and MRI activity.
   - Slow disability progression.
   - Optimise quality of life, independence, and mental health.
   - Provide ongoing education and shared decision-making on treatment options.
