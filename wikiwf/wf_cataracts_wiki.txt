CATARACTS TREATMENT WORKFLOW (from Wikipedia-based plan)

1. Initial Evaluation
   - Confirm cataract and assess functional impairment.
   - Surgery based on functional needs—not cataract “ripeness.”

2. Indications for Surgery
   - Significant functional disability.
   - Activities of daily living affected.
   - Visual function score (e.g., VF‑14) more accurate than acuity.

3. Surgical Options
   *Phacoemulsification (standard)*
     - Anesthesia (topical/subtenon)
     - Corneal incisions
     - Capsulorhexis
     - Ultrasonic lens emulsification
     - Irrigation/aspiration
     - Foldable IOL insertion

   *Alternatives*
     - ECCE (larger incision; used for hard cataracts)
     - MSICS (common in developing regions)
     - ICCE (rare, high complication rate)

4. Expected Outcome
   - ~90% patients achieve 20/40 or better with correction.

5. Postoperative Care
   - Topical antibiotics/steroids.
   - Monitor for infection, inflammation, retinal detachment.
