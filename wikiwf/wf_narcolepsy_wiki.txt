NARCOLEPSY MANAGEMENT WORKFLOW (from Wikipedia-based plan)

1. Overall approach
   - No definitive cure; aim to improve daytime alertness and control cataplexy/REM-related symptoms.
   - Combine behavioural strategies with medication.
   - Monitor for comorbid sleep disorders (e.g., obstructive sleep apnoea) and psychosocial issues.

2. Emerging orexin/hypocretin replacement
   - Experimental gene and cell therapies:
     * Prepro-orexin gene editing to induce orexin production in other neurons.
     * Stem-cell–derived hypocretin neuron transplantation.
   - Future pharmacologic strategies:
     * Hypocretin agonists (e.g., danavorexton).
     * Hypocretin 1 replacement (IV, intracisternal, or high-dose intranasal).
   - Currently research-stage, not routine clinical care.

3. Behavioural and educational management
   - Provide education for patient and family on disease mechanisms and safety (driving, machinery).
   - Optimise sleep hygiene: regular schedule, adequate nocturnal sleep.
   - Plan scheduled daytime naps (especially longer ~120-minute naps for sustained benefit).
   - Address medication adherence and side effects at regular follow-up visits.
   - Maintain open communication about school/work accommodations and psychosocial impact.

4. Pharmacologic treatment – Excessive Daytime Sleepiness (EDS)
   4.1 First-line wake-promoting agents
       - Modafinil, armodafinil.
       - Pitolisant (H3 antagonist increasing histamine release).
       - Solriamfetol (dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor).
       - Monitor for side effects (e.g., skin reactions with modafinil).
   4.2 Traditional stimulants (second-/third-line)
       - Methylphenidate, amphetamine, dextroamphetamine.
       - Used when newer agents insufficient or unavailable.

5. Pharmacologic treatment – Cataplexy and REM-related symptoms
   5.1 Sodium oxybate formulations
       - Twice-nightly sodium oxybate.
       - Twice-nightly mixed salts oxybate.
       - Once-nightly extended-release sodium oxybate.
       - Taken at night; improve cataplexy and EDS.
   5.2 REM-suppressing antidepressants
       - Tricyclics: clomipramine, imipramine, protriptyline.
       - SSRIs, SNRIs: venlafaxine and others.
       - NRIs: atomoxetine, viloxazine, reboxetine.
       - Other agents: mazindol, selegiline in selected cases.

6. Paediatric narcolepsy
   - Behavioural:
     * Sleep hygiene, scheduled naps, physical exercise.
   - Medications (carefully dosed):
     * Stimulants: methylphenidate, modafinil, amphetamine, dextroamphetamine.
     * Sodium oxybate or atomoxetine for sleepiness.
     * Sodium oxybate, venlafaxine, fluoxetine, or clomipramine for cataplexy.

7. Long-term goals
   - Maximise daytime function and safety.
   - Reduce frequency and severity of cataplexy.
   - Maintain school/work performance and psychosocial well-being.
