CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE (CKD) MANAGEMENT WORKFLOW (from Wikipedia-based plan)

1. Initial Evaluation
   - Determine CKD stage (eGFR)
   - Assess albuminuria, BP, diabetes

2. Core Management
   *Blood Pressure*
     - ACEIs/ARBs first‑line
     - Aggressive BP lowering decreases mortality
   *Diabetes*
     - SGLT2 inhibitors → kidney & heart protection
   *Lipids*
     - Statins for CKD patients (esp. >50 yrs)

3. Diet & Lifestyle
   - Plant‑dominant, low protein, low salt
   - Weight management
   - Salt restriction → ↓ BP & albuminuria

4. Medication Adjustments
   - Adjust doses of renally cleared drugs
   - Avoid nephrotoxins
   - Treat anemia (IV iron → first line; EPO as needed)
   - Treat mineral bone disease (calcitriol, phosphate binders)

5. Nephrology Referral
   - Stage 4 CKD (eGFR <30)
   - Earlier if albuminuria >30 mg/mmol or refractory hypertension.

6. Renal Replacement Therapy
   - Dialysis or transplant at Stage 5
   - Dialysis removes toxins incompletely; transplant closer to normal.
