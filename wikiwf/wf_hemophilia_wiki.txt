HEMOPHILIA MANAGEMENT WORKFLOW (from Wikipedia-based plan)

1. Baseline assessment
   - Confirm type and severity of hemophilia (A: factor VIII, B: factor IX).
   - Identify mild, moderate, or severe disease.
   - Screen for existing inhibitors to clotting factors.
   - Review bleeding history, joint status, and comorbidities.

2. Core treatment principle
   - There is no long-term cure.
   - Management is based on replacing missing clotting factors promptly and appropriately.

3. Clotting factor replacement strategy
   3.1 Mild hemophilia
       - Factor concentrates usually not needed routinely.
       - Use factor replacement ONLY around major bleeds or high-risk procedures.
       - Consider desmopressin (DDAVP) for mild hemophilia A.
   3.2 Moderate hemophilia
       - On-demand factor replacement for bleeding episodes and procedures.
       - Educate on early self-infusion where possible.
   3.3 Severe hemophilia
       - Prophylactic factor replacement 2–3 times per week, often lifelong.
       - Aim: maintain factor levels high enough to prevent spontaneous bleeding.
       - Rapid treatment of bleeds to prevent joint and tissue damage.

4. Factor products and inhibitors
   - Use factor VIII (hemophilia A) or IX (hemophilia B):
     * Plasma-derived, recombinant, or mixed origin.
   - If inhibitors develop:
     * Increase dose or switch to non-human factor (e.g., porcine factor VIII).
     * Consider immune tolerance protocols.
   - Recombinant factors minimise infection risk but are costly and less available in low-resource settings.
   - Fitusiran (Qfitlia) is now available as a newer agent in some settings.

5. Adjunctive therapies
   - Antifibrinolytics: tranexamic acid or epsilon aminocaproic acid to stabilise clots.
   - Desmopressin (DDAVP) in mild hemophilia A to raise factor VIII levels.
   - Emicizumab for severe hemophilia A already on FVIII (subcutaneous prophylaxis).
   - Pain control: analgesics, short courses of steroids, and physical therapy for joint bleeds.

6. Management of acquired hemophilia
   - Add immunosuppressive therapy:
     * First line: corticosteroids to remove autoantibodies in ~50% of cases.
     * Second line: cyclophosphamide and cyclosporine if steroids fail.
     * Third line: high-dose IV immunoglobulin or immunosorbent therapy.

7. Activity and medication contraindications
   7.1 Contraindicated medications
       - Anticoagulants: heparin, warfarin.
       - Drugs with “blood thinning” effects: aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, and similar NSAIDs.
   7.2 High-risk activities to avoid
       - Very high trauma/contact sports: American football, hockey, boxing, wrestling, rugby.
       - High-risk activities: motorcycling, skateboarding.
   7.3 Activities with caution
       - Soccer, baseball, basketball: only with specialist advice and appropriate protection.

8. Long-term goals
   - Prevent joint damage and chronic pain.
   - Minimise bleeding episodes and hospitalisations.
   - Preserve function and quality of life.
   - Provide patient and family education, home infusion training, and psychosocial support.
