TETANUS TREATMENT WORKFLOW (from Wikipedia-based plan)

1. Initial Assessment
   - Diagnose severity: mild vs. severe.
   - Evaluate airway, spasms, autonomic instability.

2. Mild Tetanus Management
   2.1 Immunotherapy
       - Tetanus immunoglobulin (TIG) IV or IM.
   2.2 Antibiotics
       - Preferred: IV metronidazole.
   2.3 Control of Spasms
       - Benzodiazepines: diazepam or lorazepam.

3. Severe Tetanus Management
   - ICU admission required.
   - Additional steps:
     3.1 Intrathecal TIG (improves outcomes).
     3.2 Airway & Ventilation
         - Tracheotomy + mechanical ventilation 3–4 weeks.
     3.3 Spasm & Autonomic Control
         - Continuous IV diazepam.
         - IV magnesium sulfate.
         - Agents for autonomic instability: labetalol, clonidine, magnesium, nifedipine.
     3.4 Paralytic Agents
         - Curare‑like drugs if extreme spasms; ventilatory support required.

4. Nutrition Support
   - High‑calorie (3500–4000 kcal/day) & protein intake ≥150 g/day.
   - Enteral feeding via PEG or parenteral nutrition.

5. Recovery
   - Nerve terminal regeneration → 4–6 weeks.
   - Continue monitoring for respiratory, cardiac complications.

6. Primary Goals
   - Maintain airway.
   - Control spasms.
   - Reduce toxin effects.
   - Support metabolic demands.
