CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME TREATMENT WORKFLOW (from Wikipedia-based plan)

1. Assessment & Diagnosis
   - Confirm CTS: numbness, tingling, pain in median nerve distribution.
   - Determine severity & chronicity.
   - Identify underlying conditions (diabetes, pregnancy, RA, trauma).
   - Distinguish disease‑modifying vs. palliative options.

2. Conservative First-Line Management
   2.1 Splint Immobilization
       - Night wrist splints to keep neutral position.
       - Optional daytime use only for specific aggravating tasks.
       - Avoid full‑day immobilization to prevent stiffness/weakness.
   2.2 Try alternative conservative therapy every 2–7 weeks if no improvement.

3. Corticosteroid Therapy
   - Local corticosteroid injection for short‑term symptom relief.
   - Ultrasound guidance speeds resolution.
   - Not disease‑modifying; used until definitive therapy chosen.
   - Avoid repeated long‑term injections.

4. Physical & Occupational Therapy
   - Manual therapy: soft tissue mobilization, massage, bone manipulations.
   - Neurodynamic nerve‑gliding & tendon‑gliding exercises.
   - Functional massage & carpal bone mobilization.
   - Stretching more effective when performed with trained therapist.

5. Disease‑Modifying Surgical Management
   - Indications:
     * Constant numbness, weakness, atrophy.
     * Failure of conservative therapy.
     * Elective by patient preference OR denervation on EMG.
   - Procedure: carpal tunnel release (transverse ligament cut).
   - Anesthesia: local, regional, or general.
   - Severe cases typically progress to surgery.

6. Alternative Medicine (not recommended)
   - Acupuncture, laser therapy, magnet therapy, B6 → minimal/no proven benefit.
