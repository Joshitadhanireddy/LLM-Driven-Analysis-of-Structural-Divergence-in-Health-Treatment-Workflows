COMMON COLD MANAGEMENT WORKFLOW (from Wikipedia-based plan)

1. Supportive Care
   - Rest, hydration, warm salt‑water gargles

2. Symptomatic Relief
   *Pain/Fever*
     - Ibuprofen, acetaminophen
   *Cough/Congestion*
     - OTC cough meds: limited evidence; avoid in <6 yrs
     - Nasal decongestants (small benefit in adults)
     - Antihistamines → mild benefit first 1–2 days
     - Ipratropium nasal spray → helpful for runny nose
     - Vapor rub → some nighttime relief

3. Not Recommended / Limited Evidence
   - Intranasal steroids
   - Excess fluids
   - Heated/humidified air
   - Garlic, Echinacea, Chinese herbs

4. Antibiotics / Antivirals
   - Antibiotics not effective (viral)
   - No proven antivirals

5. Zinc
   - May reduce duration if started ≤24 hours
   - Nasal zinc → anosmia risk

6. Vitamins
   - Vitamin C reduces duration only if taken consistently before illness
   - Vitamin D not proven effective

7. Exercise
   - Avoid if systemic symptoms (fever, fatigue)
   - Light exercise okay if symptoms above neck only
