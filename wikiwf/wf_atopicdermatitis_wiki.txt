ATOPIC DERMATITIS (ECZEMA) MANAGEMENT WORKFLOW (from Wikipedia-based plan)

1. Baseline assessment
   - Confirm diagnosis of atopic dermatitis (AD) and rule out mimics.
   - Grade severity (e.g. using SCORAD or EASI).
   - Identify triggers (irritants, infections, allergens, climate, stress).

2. Core daily skin care (all severities)
   2.1 Emollient therapy (first-line maintenance)
       - Liberal, regular application of moisturisers (lotions/creams/gels/ointments).
       - Tailor formulation to age, body site, season, and preference.
       - Use as leave-on treatments and soap substitutes.
       - Note: emollient bath additives provide no additional benefit over leave-on products.
   2.2 Bathing and clothing
       - Regular lukewarm baths/showers; consider saltwater baths in some.
       - Consider dilute bleach baths in moderate–severe AD with recurrent Staph. aureus.
       - Avoid large-diameter wool and scratchy fibres; use fine merino or smooth fibres.
       - Silk clothes are safe but do not necessarily improve disease.

3. Topical anti-inflammatory treatment for flares
   3.1 Topical corticosteroids (first-line for flares)
       - Choose potency based on site and severity:
         * Mild–moderate: lower potency; moderate–severe: moderate/strong potency.
       - Apply once daily (equivalent to twice daily).
       - Use intermittent high/moderate potency during flares; generally safe and do not
         cause skin thinning when used intermittently as directed.
       - For flare prevention: consider “weekend therapy” (twice weekly application).
   3.2 Topical calcineurin inhibitors
       - Tacrolimus or pimecrolimus as first-line alternatives or adjuncts, especially
         for sensitive areas (face, skin folds) or steroid-sparing.
       - Use for active lesions and as maintenance to reduce flares.
   3.3 Other topical agents
       - Crisaborole (PDE-4 inhibitor) for mild-to-moderate disease.
       - Ruxolitinib (topical JAK inhibitor) – efficacy and safety remain uncertain.

4. Escalation to systemic therapy (moderate–severe, refractory to topical care)
   4.1 Conventional systemic immunosuppressants
       - Options: ciclosporin, methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate.
       - Use when topical regimens are insufficient; monitor for systemic toxicity.
   4.2 Symptomatic agents
       - Antihistamines or certain antidepressants may be used to help with itch and sleep.
   4.3 Biologics and JAK inhibitors
       - Highly effective but may increase risk of conjunctivitis.
       - Agents include:
         * Dupilumab, tralokinumab, lebrikizumab (monoclonal antibodies).
         * Abrocitinib, baricitinib, upadacitinib (oral JAK inhibitors).
       - Indicated for moderate–severe AD not controlled by conventional therapy.
       - Nemolizumab (anti-IL-31 receptor) also approved for AD in some regions.

5. Infection management
   - Suspect secondary infection when:
     * Oozing, yellow crusting, worsening eczema, fever.
   - Typical pathogen: Staphylococcus aureus.
   - Use systemic or topical antibiotics only when systemic symptoms or clear infection
     are present, due to limited benefit and antimicrobial resistance risk.

6. Diet and supplements (adjuncts)
   - Vitamin D: may improve symptoms in some, but role remains unclear.
   - Omega-3 LCPUFA in pregnancy: no clear benefit in preventing AD in offspring.
   - Probiotics: multi-strain preparations may reduce AD incidence by ~20%.
   - Gluten-free diet:
       - Indicated only for co-existing coeliac disease or non-coeliac gluten sensitivity.
   - Use IgE or skin prick tests for diet exclusion cautiously; limited evidence supports their use
     for routine dietary management of AD.

7. Phototherapy
   - Consider narrowband UVB phototherapy for moderate–severe AD not controlled by topical
     and systemic treatments.
   - Weigh benefits against long-term skin cancer risk.
   - Avoid routine phototherapy in children and young adults where cumulative UV risk is high.

8. Self-management and patient education
   - Explain chronic, relapsing nature of AD; set realistic expectations (control, not cure).
   - Provide written action plan:
     * Daily care regimen.
     * How to escalate treatment during flares.
   - Address steroid phobia and treatment concerns explicitly.
   - Emphasise adherence to moisturisers and topical regimens.
   - Offer/point to web-based self-management resources when available.

9. Alternative and complementary therapies (generally not recommended)
   - Chinese herbal medicines (topical or oral): no strong evidence of benefit.
   - Acupuncture, manual therapies, air ionisers: insufficient evidence of efficacy.
   - Microbiome-based topical products are under investigation, not standard of care.

10. Follow-up and outcome monitoring
   - Regularly reassess disease severity (SCORAD/EASI), itch, sleep, and QoL.
   - Adjust step of therapy up or down according to control and side effects.
   - Monitor for adverse effects of long-term corticosteroids and systemic agents.
