GERD (GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE) TREATMENT WORKFLOW (from Wikipedia-based plan)

1. Lifestyle & Nutrition Therapy
   - Avoid triggers: chocolate, mint, alcohol, high‑fat foods
   - Weight loss if overweight
   - No meals within 2–3 hrs of bed; elevate head of bed
   - Avoid tight clothing & smoking
   - Increase fiber; reduce sugars
   - Breathing exercises may help

2. Medications
   *PPIs (e.g., omeprazole)*
     - Most effective
     - Take 30–60 minutes before meals
     - Use lowest effective long‑term dose
   *H2 Blockers*
     - ~40% improvement
   *Antacids + alginic acid*
     - ~60% improvement
   *Other*
     - Sucralfate: effective but frequent dosing
     - Baclofen: effective but many side effects
     - Avoid metoclopramide

3. Surgical Options
   - Nissen fundoplication (standard for refractory GERD)
   - LINX magnetic sphincter (fewer bloat-related complications)
   - TIF (endoscopic): lasts up to 6 years
   - Esophagogastric dissociation: for neurologically impaired children

4. Pregnancy Management
   - Lifestyle modifications first
   - Calcium‑based antacids preferred
   - Sucralfate, cimetidine, PPIs considered safe

5. Infant Management
   - Smaller, frequent feeds; upright positioning
   - Avoid leg‑lift diaper changes → use log‑roll technique
   - PPIs/H2 blockers not effective in infants
