POLYCYSTIC OVARY SYNDROME (PCOS) MANAGEMENT WORKFLOW (from Wikipedia-based plan)

1. Overall principles
   - No cure; focus on symptom relief and long-term risk reduction.
   - Key domains: metabolic health, menstrual regulation, fertility, hirsutism/acne, and mental health.
   - Lifestyle change is first-line therapy for most.

2. Lifestyle and weight management (first-line)
   - Goals: prevent weight gain, achieve modest weight loss (>5%), or maintain weight loss.
   - Diet: any sustainable healthy eating pattern; no single superior diet.
   - Exercise:
     * ≥150 min/week moderate intensity to prevent weight gain.
     * ~250 min/week for weight loss.
   - Behavioural support:
     * Goal setting, progress tracking, assertiveness training, relapse prevention.
     * Use SMART goals and cognitive-behavioural strategies.
   - Address barriers: disordered eating, poor body image, sleep disorders, low motivation.

3. Metabolic management
   3.1 Metformin
       - Indications:
         * BMI >25 with insulin resistance or dyslipidaemia.
         * Can be considered for irregular periods (including in adolescents).
       - Benefits: improved insulin resistance and lipids; some menstrual benefit.
       - Side effects: abdominal pain, metallic taste, diarrhoea, vomiting.
   3.2 GLP-1 receptor agonists (e.g., liraglutide, semaglutide)
       - More potent metabolic improvements than metformin alone.
       - Combination with metformin is strongest.
       - Positive effects on menses and androgens in small trials.
       - NOT recommended when trying to conceive; stop ≥2 months before pregnancy.
   3.3 Other
       - Inositol may help metabolic parameters but metformin is preferred for hirsutism and abdominal fat.

4. Menstrual irregularity and androgen excess (hirsutism, acne)
   4.1 Combined oral contraceptives (COCs)
       - First-line for menstrual regulation and androgen symptoms.
       - Mechanism: ↑ sex hormone–binding globulin, ↓ androgens.
       - Reduces endometrial cancer risk via regular shedding.
       - Progestogen-only pills regulate menses but do NOT treat androgen excess.
   4.2 Anti-androgens
       - Options: spironolactone, flutamide, finasteride.
       - Use when COCs are contraindicated or insufficient.
       - Combine with COCs for androgenic alopecia or severe hirsutism.
       - Finasteride is contraindicated in pregnancy (teratogenic).
   4.3 Hair and skin-directed therapies
       - Laser hair removal, shaving, topical acne therapies adjunctive to hormonal control.

5. Infertility management in PCOS
   5.1 Preconception optimisation
       - Lifestyle and weight reduction as first step.
       - GLP-1 agonists may be used for weight loss but must be stopped before conception.
   5.2 Ovulation induction (from most to less effective)
       - First-line: letrozole (higher pregnancy and live birth rates than clomiphene).
       - Next options:
         * Metformin + clomiphene.
         * Clomiphene alone.
         * Metformin alone (least effective, more GI side effects).
       - Gonadotrophin therapy effective but high risk of multiple pregnancy; requires monitoring.
   5.3 Surgical options
       - Laparoscopic ovarian drilling:
         * Puncture of 4–10 follicles using electrocautery/laser/biopsy needle.
         * Can induce ovulation and favour single pregnancy.
         * Higher risks and possibly lower live birth rate vs. medical treatment.
       - Ovarian wedge resection: largely obsolete due to adhesion risk and effective medicines.
   5.4 Assisted reproduction
       - IVF for refractory cases:
         * Higher risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).
         * “Freeze-all” strategy with single embryo transfer reduces OHSS risk.
       - In vitro maturation as a safer but less effective alternative to full IVF.

6. Mental health and psychosocial care
   - Screen for:
     * Depression and anxiety (at diagnosis and follow-up as clinically indicated).
     * Eating disorders and body image distress (when suspected).
     * Psychosexual dysfunction in consenting sexually active women.
   - Treat mood disorders with standard therapies (psychotherapy, antidepressants).
   - Cognitive behavioural therapy for low self-esteem, body image concerns, disordered eating, and sexual dysfunction.

7. Long-term cardiometabolic risk screening
   - Glucose tolerance:
     * Two-hour oral glucose tolerance test at diagnosis.
     * Repeat every 1–3 years based on risk factors.
   - Cardiovascular risk:
     * Periodic lipid profile.
     * Annual blood pressure measurement.
   - Provide ongoing counselling about lifestyle, pregnancy risks, and long-term follow-up needs.

8. Overall goals
   - Restore or maintain menstrual regularity and fertility as desired.
   - Improve metabolic health and reduce diabetes/cardiovascular risk.
   - Control hirsutism and acne to improve self-esteem and quality of life.
   - Support emotional wellbeing and long-term self-management.
