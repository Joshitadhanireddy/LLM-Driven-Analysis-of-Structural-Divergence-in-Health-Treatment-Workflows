ACROMEGALY TREATMENT WORKFLOW (from Wikipedia-based plan)

1. Confirm indication for treatment
   - Established diagnosis of acromegaly with elevated GH/IGF-1.
   - Evaluate tumour size, location, and operability (pituitary vs ectopic).

2. First-line: Pituitary tumour surgery (if feasible)
   2.1 Choose approach
       - Prefer endonasal transsphenoidal surgery (less invasive, better tumour access).
       - Consider traditional transsphenoidal approach via upper gum/septum only if needed.
   2.2 Perform surgery
       - Aim: remove as much adenoma as safely possible, relieve pressure on surrounding brain.
   2.3 Immediate post-op assessment
       - Monitor for complications: CSF leak, meningitis, hypopituitarism.
       - Begin hormone replacement if other pituitary hormones are deficient.
   2.4 Biochemical outcome check
       - Measure GH/IGF-1:
         * Ideal: GH < 2 ng/mL after oral glucose load and normal IGF-1.
       - IF hormone levels normalised → go to Step 6 (long-term follow-up).
       - IF hormone levels remain elevated or tumour remnant persists → go to Step 3.

3. Medical therapy (if surgery contraindicated, incomplete, or not curative)
   3.1 Start somatostatin analogue (first-line medical treatment)
       - Options: octreotide (Sandostatin), lanreotide (Somatuline).
       - Long-acting depot forms every 2–4 weeks.
       - Possible roles:
         * Primary therapy when surgery not possible.
         * Adjunct/secondary therapy after suboptimal surgery.
         * Pre-operative tumour shrinkage when needed.
   3.2 Monitor response and adverse effects
       - Clinical: headache relief, soft tissue changes, symptom improvement.
       - Biochemical: GH/IGF-1 levels.
       - Adverse effects:
         * GI symptoms: loose stools, nausea, gas.
         * Gallstones (often asymptomatic).
         * Possible glucose intolerance/diabetes.
   3.3 If resistant/inadequate control with standard SSA
       - Consider second-generation SSA such as pasireotide for aggressive adenomas.
       - Closely monitor insulin and glucose due to hyperglycaemia risk.

4. Add / switch to adjunct medical options as needed
   4.1 Dopamine agonist
       - Indication:
         * Inadequate response/intolerance to somatostatin analogue.
         * Tumour co-secretes prolactin.
       - Agent: cabergoline (oral).
       - Often used as add-on to SSA to improve control at lower cost.
       - Monitor adverse effects: GI upset, nausea, orthostatic symptoms, nasal congestion.
   4.2 Growth hormone receptor antagonist
       - Indication:
         * Persistent disease activity despite SSA ± dopamine agonist.
       - Agent: pegvisomant (Somavert).
         * Daily subcutaneous injections.
         * Option: combine long-acting SSA with weekly pegvisomant instead of daily dosing.
       - Aim: normalise IGF-1 by blocking peripheral GH action even if GH remains elevated.

5. Radiotherapy (adjuvant or salvage)
   5.1 Indications
       - Significant tumour remnant after surgery not controlled by meds.
       - Patients in whom surgery and/or medications are insufficient or not tolerated.
   5.2 Protocol
       - Fractionated external-beam radiotherapy over 4–6 weeks.
       - Expect ~50% GH reduction over 2–5 years, with further improvement over >5 years.
   5.3 Long-term monitoring for radiotherapy effects
       - Progressive loss of other pituitary hormones → need for hormone replacement.
       - Rare complications: visual loss, brain injury.

6. Long-term follow-up and surveillance
   6.1 Biochemical surveillance
       - Periodic GH and IGF-1 testing, even after apparent cure.
       - Watch for recurrence or drift in hormone control.
   6.2 Imaging surveillance
       - Periodic pituitary MRI to assess for regrowth or residual tumour.
   6.3 Management of complications and comorbidities
       - Screen and treat: diabetes, hypertension, sleep apnoea, arthropathy, cardiovascular risk.
   6.4 Patient education
       - Explain chronic nature and need for long-term monitoring.
       - Discuss signs of recurrence and importance of follow-up visits.

7. Overall treatment goals
   - Normalise GH and IGF-1 levels.
   - Remove or control tumour mass.
   - Prevent or treat complications of therapy (surgery, drugs, radiotherapy).
   - Restore life expectancy to normal and improve quality of life.
