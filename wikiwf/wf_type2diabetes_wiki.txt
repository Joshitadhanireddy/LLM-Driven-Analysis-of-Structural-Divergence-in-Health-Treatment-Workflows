TYPE 2 DIABETES MANAGEMENT WORKFLOW (from Wikipedia-based plan)

1. Initial Management Goals
   - Normalize blood glucose (HbA1c target ~7–8%).
   - Reduce cardiovascular risk (BP, lipids, kidney health).
   - Educate on glucose monitoring (SMBG optional in non‑insulin users).

2. Lifestyle Interventions (foundation)
   2.1 Exercise
       - Regular aerobic + resistance training.
       - Improves glucose, fat, and lipid profile.
   2.2 Diet
       - Calorie restriction for weight loss.
       - Consider DASH, Mediterranean, low‑fat, or low‑carb diets.
       - High fiber; lower saturated fats.
       - Tree nuts → reduced fasting glucose.
       - Cultural/education-based programs improve control up to 24 months.
   2.3 Stress Management
       - Mindfulness may help; evidence under review.

3. Medication Algorithm
   3.1 First-Line
       - Metformin (unless severe renal/hepatic disease).
       - In patients with ASCVD, HF, CKD → start GLP‑1 RA or SGLT2 inhibitor first‑line.
   3.2 Additional Drug Classes
       - Sulfonylureas, TZDs, DPP‑4 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP‑1 agonists.
   3.3 Insulin
       - Add long‑acting insulin if oral agents insufficient.
       - Start nightly; titrate; consider BID if needed.

4. Blood Pressure Management
   - General target: <140/90 mmHg.
   - Intensive lowering (<130 mmHg) not clearly beneficial; risk of harm.
   - ACEi or ARB preferred if CKD or albuminuria.

5. Lipid & Antiplatelet Management
   - Statins for cardiovascular risk reduction.
   - Aspirin only for secondary prevention or selected high‑risk individuals.

6. Monitoring & Preventive Care
   - Regular eye exams.
   - Treat gum disease → improves glycemic control.
   - Share health records → better patient engagement.

7. Bariatric Surgery
   - Consider for obese patients failing medical therapy.
   - High remission rates but carries small surgical risk.

8. Long‑Term Goals
   - Maintain glycemic control.
   - Prevent micro/macrovascular complications.
   - Improve longevity & quality of life.
