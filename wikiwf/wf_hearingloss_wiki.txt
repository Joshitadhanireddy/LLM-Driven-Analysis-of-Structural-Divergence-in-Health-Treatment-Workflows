AGE‑RELATED HEARING LOSS (PRESBYCUSIS) MANAGEMENT WORKFLOW (from Wikipedia-based plan)

1. Initial Evaluation
   - Confirm sensorineural age‑related hearing loss.
   - No curative or preventive pharmacologic therapy.
   - Categorize severity: mild/moderate/severe/profound.

2. Non‑Surgical Management
   2.1 Hearing Aids
       - First-line for most patients.
       - Tune to individualized frequency-specific deficits.
   2.2 Aural Rehabilitation
       - Communication strategies.
       - Face speaker directly, improve lighting, reduce background noise.
       - Teach partners supportive speaking behaviors.

3. Surgical Management
   3.1 Cochlear Implant (for severe/profound cases)
       - External processor + implanted electrode array.
       - Electrodes stimulate cochlear nerve via tonotopic mapping.
       - Improves speech/environmental sound recognition.
   3.2 Middle Ear Implants
       - Implanted device vibrates ossicles directly.
       - Hidden cosmetic profile; for selected patients.

4. Long‑Term Goals
   - Improve communication, reduce disability.
   - Maintain social interaction & safety.
   - Annual reassessment of hearing function.
