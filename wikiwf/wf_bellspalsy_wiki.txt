BELL'S PALSY MANAGEMENT WORKFLOW (from Wikipedia-based plan)

1. Initial evaluation
   - Confirm diagnosis of acute, unilateral lower motor neuron facial palsy.
   - Exclude alternative causes (stroke, tumours, Lyme disease, trauma) based on history and exam.
   - Document ability to close eyelids and presence of corneal exposure.
   - Note special populations: pregnancy (overall management is similar to non-pregnant).

2. Core early treatment (within first 72 hours of onset)
   2.1 Start oral corticosteroids (first-line, unless contraindicated)
       - Example: prednisone regimen as per local guidelines.
       - Aim: initiate within 3 days of symptom onset to maximise recovery benefit.
       - Expected benefit: ~14% greater probability of recovery at 6 months.
   2.2 Consider antivirals as add-on (optional, evidence mixed)
       - Agents: aciclovir/valaciclovir.
       - Evidence:
         * Limited/uncertain added benefit beyond steroids, particularly in mild–moderate disease.
         * Some reviews suggest possible small benefit; use is often based on theoretical viral aetiology.
       - Reserve for:
         * Severe paresis or complete paralysis, or
         * Clinical suspicion of herpes simplex/varicella zoster involvement (e.g. vesicles).

3. Eye protection (for incomplete eye closure)
   - Assess blink reflex and corneal exposure.
   - If eye cannot close completely:
     3.1 Daytime protection
         - Frequent lubricating eye drops (artificial tears).
         - Protective glasses or moisture chambers if needed.
     3.2 Night-time protection
         - Lubricating ointment.
         - Patching or taping eyelids closed during sleep/rest.
   - Refer urgently to ophthalmology if corneal damage is suspected.

4. Physiotherapy and rehabilitation
   - Consider early physiotherapy in patients with more severe or prolonged weakness.
   - Components:
     * Facial muscle re-education exercises.
     * Soft tissue techniques to maintain muscle tone and reduce risk of contractures.
   - Use local heat to reduce pain on the affected side if needed.
   - Electrical stimulation currently lacks high-quality evidence and is not routinely recommended.

5. Monitoring and follow-up
   - Short-term (first weeks)
     * Reassess facial function, pain, ability to close eye.
     * Ensure adherence to eye protection and steroid course.
   - Medium-term (3–6 months)
     * Monitor for recovery; many patients recover substantially.
     * If no or minimal recovery by 3–6 months, consider further evaluation.
   - Screen for psychosocial impact (appearance, speech, eating) and provide support.

6. Consideration of surgical options (for persistent palsy or sequelae)
   - Indications:
     * Long-standing facial nerve paralysis with incomplete recovery.
   - Possible interventions:
     * Various facial nerve and muscle transfer procedures.
     * “Smile surgery”/smile reconstruction to restore dynamic facial movement.
   - Risks:
     * Possible hearing loss (reported in ~3–15% in some procedures).
   - Evidence:
     * As of available reviews, benefits of early decompression surgery remain uncertain;
       some professional bodies do not recommend routine decompression.

7. Alternative therapies (currently not standard of care)
   - Acupuncture: efficacy remains unclear due to low-quality evidence.
   - Hyperbaric oxygen therapy: tentative evidence suggests possible benefit in severe disease,
     but not established as routine therapy.

8. Long-term goals
   - Protect the eye from exposure keratopathy.
   - Maximise spontaneous and aided recovery of facial nerve function.
   - Minimise permanent disfigurement, synkinesis, and disability.
   - Support psychological adjustment and social functioning.
