PROGERIA (HGPS) TREATMENT WORKFLOW (from Wikipedia-based plan)

1. Core Disease‑Modifying Therapy
   - Lonafarnib (FDA‑approved FTI, 2020)
     * Twice‑daily oral capsules.
     * Reduces progerin accumulation.
     * Significant mortality reduction (3.7% vs. 33.3%).
     * Side effects: nausea, diarrhea, infections, fatigue.
     * Major cost & access limitations.

2. Management of Complications
   2.1 Cardiovascular Disease
       - Low‑dose aspirin.
       - Coronary artery bypass or other cardiac surgery when indicated.
   2.2 Growth Hormone
       - Has been attempted; mixed evidence.

3. Experimental & Adjunct Approaches
   - Morpholinos targeting abnormal LMNA splicing (preclinical).
   - Other FTIs (animal models).
   - Rapamycin (mTOR inhibitor):
     * Removes progerin aggregates via autophagy.
     * Observed only in vitro.
   - Pravastatin + zoledronate (reported benefit; evidence limited).
   - CRM1 inhibition (selinexor under validation).

4. Supportive Care
   - Multidisciplinary cardiac monitoring.
   - Nutrition, physical therapy, psychosocial support.

5. Goals
   - Slow disease progression.
   - Reduce cardiovascular events.
   - Improve lifespan & quality of life.
