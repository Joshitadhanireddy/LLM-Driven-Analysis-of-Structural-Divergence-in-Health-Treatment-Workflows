ASTHMA MANAGEMENT WORKFLOW (from Wikipedia-based plan)

1. Initial assessment
   - Confirm asthma diagnosis and pattern of symptoms.
   - Assess severity: frequency of symptoms/exacerbations, lung function (if available).
   - Identify comorbidities (allergic rhinitis, obesity, anxiety/depression, smoking).

2. Identify and manage triggers (all patients)
   2.1 Take structured trigger history:
       - Allergens (dust mites, pets, pollen, mould).
       - Smoke exposure (cigarette, second-hand, other combustion).
       - Air pollution, occupational exposures, beta-blockers, sulfites, etc.
   2.2 Implement lifestyle/environmental measures:
       - Avoid/stop smoking; minimise second-hand smoke.
       - Reduce exposure to known personal allergens where feasible.
       - Note: dust mite control measures and dehumidifiers show limited benefit overall.
   2.3 Promote beneficial lifestyle:
       - Encourage regular exercise for stable asthma.
       - Consider yoga as adjunct for modest symptom/QoL benefit.
       - Weight management in overweight patients.

3. Education and self-management setup
   - Provide asthma education tailored to culture and literacy.
   - Develop a written asthma action plan (symptoms/PEF-based where possible).
   - Train in inhaler technique and spacer use; review regularly.
   - Discuss adherence barriers (cost, fears of steroids, misconceptions).
   - For children, consider school- and home-based education programs.

4. Pharmacologic treatment – acute symptom relief (all severities)
   4.1 Quick-relief bronchodilators
       - First-line: short-acting beta2-agonists (SABA) e.g. salbutamol/albuterol.
       - Use before exercise in exercise-induced symptoms.
   4.2 Add-on in moderate/severe exacerbations
       - Inhaled anticholinergics (ipratropium) + SABA for ED/hospital settings.
       - Systemic corticosteroids (oral/IV) for moderate–severe exacerbations.
       - Consider nebulised/IV magnesium sulphate in severe attacks.
       - Provide humidified oxygen if SpO2 < 92%.
       - Escalate to mechanical ventilation only in life-threatening hypoxaemia.

5. Long-term control – stepwise controller therapy
   5.1 Mild intermittent (occasional attacks)
       - SABA as needed.
   5.2 Mild persistent (>2 attacks/week)
       - Preferred: low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS).
       - Alternatives: leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) or mast cell stabiliser.
   5.3 Moderate persistent / daily symptoms
       - Increase ICS dose (medium) or
       - Add long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) to low/medium-dose ICS in adults.
       - LTRA can be used as add-on; particularly considered in children or ICS-intolerant.
   5.4 Severe persistent / difficult-to-treat asthma
       - High-dose ICS ± LABA ± additional controller:
         * LTRA or 5-LOX inhibitor (zileuton in older children/adults).
         * Theophylline (less favoured due to side effects).
         * Add-on tiotropium or other agents as per specialist.
       - For allergic/eosinophilic severe asthma:
         * Consider biologics: omalizumab (anti-IgE), mepolizumab, reslizumab, benralizumab,
           dupilumab, etc., depending on phenotype and local availability.
       - For non-responsive severe cases:
         * Consider azithromycin (macrolide) for reduction in exacerbations in selected patients.
       - For selected adults with very severe persistent asthma:
         * Consider bronchial thermoplasty after specialist evaluation.

6. Route and device selection
   - Preferred: metered-dose inhaler (MDI) with spacer or dry powder inhaler.
   - Nebuliser as alternative, especially in acute settings.
   - Emphasise spacer use in children with SABA (at least as effective as nebuliser in mild–moderate).
   - Regularly re-check inhaler technique.

7. Monitoring, stepping up and stepping down
   7.1 Routine follow-up
       - Review symptoms, exacerbations, SABA use, inhaler technique, adherence.
       - Screen for anxiety, stress, depression and address as these worsen control.
   7.2 Step up treatment
       - If uncontrolled despite good adherence and technique.
       - Differentiate refractory asthma from difficult-to-treat (poor adherence, access issues).
   7.3 Step down treatment
       - When well controlled for several months, consider reducing ICS dose carefully.
       - Stopping LABA in stable adults on ICS+LABA may increase exacerbations; weigh risks.

8. Special investigations and adjuncts
   - Consider exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) for guiding ICS dosing in selected patients.
   - Consider pulse oximeter for home monitoring in some individuals, but emphasise clinical symptoms.
   - For overlapping COPD/asthma (ACOS), individualise therapy; some may respond to azithromycin.

9. Emergency and hospital care pathway
   - Triage severity (PEF, SpO2, accessory muscle use, speech, consciousness).
   - Immediate SABA ± ipratropium via MDI/spacer or nebuliser.
   - Early systemic corticosteroids.
   - Add oxygen; consider IV magnesium sulphate in moderate–severe attacks.
   - Escalate to ICU, non-invasive ventilation or intubation for impending respiratory arrest.

10. Long-term goals
   - Minimal or no daytime/night-time symptoms.
   - No activity limitation; normal or near-normal lung function.
   - Minimal need for reliever medication.
   - Prevention of severe exacerbations, ED visits, and treatment side effects.
