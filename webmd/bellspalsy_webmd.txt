--- Bell’s Palsy Treatment ---


If you have Bell's palsy, you're likely to make a full recovery even if you don't get treatment. But there are some things that may help you heal faster.

  - Corticosteroids (such asprednisone). These can help ease swelling of your facial nerve and help it start working normally faster. Corticosteroids work best if you take them soon after the start of your symptoms.
  - Antiviral drugs. Antiviral medications such as acyclovir (Sitavig, Zovirax) and valacyclovir (Valtrex) are sometimes prescribed in combination with corticosteroids, typically in severe cases of Bell's palsy. They don't seem to have much effect when they're taken alone.
  - Eye drops. If your Bell's palsy affects your ability to blink and close your eye, use eye drops or an ointment to keep it moist. Wear an eye patch to keep dirt and dust out and moisture in.
  - Surgery. Surgery is usually a last resort if your symptoms don’t go away, or if you have complications.

Bell’s palsy physical therapy

Even temporary paralysis can shrink and shorten your muscles.Physical therapymay help strengthen your facial muscles and help you get back facial coordination. You can also try massaging your face with your fingertips or exercising your facial muscles. Try to move every part of your face gently and slowly, using your fingers to help.

Is Bell’s palsy permanent?

While most people with Bell’s palsy completely recover, sometimes the symptoms are permanent. This may be the case if you still feel numbness or weakness on one side of your face after 6-12 months.

Your doctor can test to see if your facial nerves are showing signs of healing. If not, they may recommendcosmetic proceduresto help you close your eye or fix a crooked smile. Or they may suggest surgery to help restore your facial muscles. These procedures may include nerve grafts to connect paralyzed facial muscles to healthy nerve tissue or moving healthy muscles from one part of your face to the paralyzed corner of your mouth.

How long does Bell's palsy last?

Once your symptoms start, they usually get worse over the next 48-72 hours. But, over the next few weeks, you should begin to see improvements in both the feeling and movement in your face. After 3 months, you'll probably be able to move your face like normal again.

Sometimes, however, the facial nerves don't heal correctly, and you may have long-term effects, such as:

  - Lopsided face
  - Crooked smile
  - Involuntary facial movements, such as closing an eye when you smile
  - Tightness of facial or neck muscles
  - Narrowing of eyes
  - Smile lines
  - Chin dimpling
  - Sagging skin around your neck

Bell’s palsy recovery signs

Because your symptoms can last for weeks or months, you may get frustrated or worried that you might not get better. It takes time for damaged nerve fibers to repair themselves.

The first signs that you're healing are usually evident in your muscle tone. You may notice the droopy side of your face looking less droopy. Next, your facial movements should start to return to normal.

Remember, most people recover fully from Bell's palsy in time.
