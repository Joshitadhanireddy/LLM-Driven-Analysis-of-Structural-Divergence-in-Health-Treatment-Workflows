--- Narcolepsy Treatment ---


There’s no cure for narcolepsy. But treatment can help ease your symptoms and improve your quality of life.

Medications for narcolepsy

Drugs your doctor can prescribe to treat narcolepsy include:

Stimulants.These drugs treat sleepiness. Two common choices are modafinil (Provigil) or armodafinil (Nuvigil). Older drugs such as methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta) or amphetamines (Adderall XR, Dexedrine) are sometimes prescribed, but they can be habit-forming.

Antidepressants.Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can address problems with REM sleep. Examples includevenlafaxine (Effexor XR), fluoxetine (Prozac), and sertraline (Zoloft).Tricyclic antidepressants such asprotriptyline, imipramine (Tofranil), and clomipramine (Anafranil) can treat cataplexy.

Sodium oxybate.Also known by the brand names Xyrem and Xywav, this drug treats cataplexy.

Pitolisant (Wakix) or solriamfetol (Sunosi).These drugs help you stay awake for longer periods.

Alternative treatments for narcolepsy

There's little evidence that any alternative or natural treatment can reduce narcolepsy symptoms. But some people have found that massage therapy improves their sleep patterns.

Also, one small study found that meditation-relaxation therapy reduced how often people with narcolepsy had sleep paralysis. In this type of therapy, you learn techniques to reassure yourself, shift your focus, and relax your muscles.

Always check with your doctor before you try any alternative treatment.

Home remedies for narcolepsy

Some lifestyle changes can also help with narcolepsy symptoms:

  - Stay away from caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine.
  - Follow a regular exercise and meal schedule. Eat smaller meals more often instead of heavy meals.
  - Control your sleep schedule. Try to go to sleep and wake up at about the same time every day.
  - Schedule several daytime naps, each lasting 10-15 minutes.
  - Exercise regularly. Plan a moderate workout 4-5 hours before your bedtime.
