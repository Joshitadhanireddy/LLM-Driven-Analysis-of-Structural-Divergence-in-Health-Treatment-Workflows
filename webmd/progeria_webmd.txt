--- Progeria Treatments ---


There's no cure for progeria, but researchers are working on finding one. As of now, one drug has been approved by the FDA to slow the disease’s course:lonafarnib(Zokinvy). This medication falls into a class of experimental cancer drugs called farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs). Taking this drug helps people with progeria to gain weight. It also improves their bone and heart health. Studies have shown that the lonafarnib extends the lifespan of people with progeria by an average of 4.5 years.

Other types of drugs also may prove helpful. Current research focuses on developing therapies that will correct the gene variant that causes the disease. Another potential treatment target: reducing the amount of progerin produced by the cells of people with progeria. Early experiments on mice have shown promise.

Though drugs can’t yet cure progeria, some treatments can improve the symptoms of the disease and address its complications, such as heart disease. These include:

  - Low-dose aspirin to help preventheart attacksandstroke
  - Statins or other cholesterol-lowering medications
  - Blood thinners to prevent blood clots
  - Physical therapy to help with movement and daily activities
  - Dietary changes that ensure adequate nutrition
  - Hearing aids
  - Vision care

People with progeria also benefit from regular exams to evaluate their heart health and other aspects of disease progression. The tests used include:

  - Echocardiograms and electrocardiograms to monitor heart health
  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and other imaging tests for warning signs of stroke as well as to evaluate common symptoms like headaches and seizures
  - Hearing tests
  - Eye tests
  - Regular visits to a dentist familiar with progeria
  - Evaluations of skin problems
  - Testing for bone problems

Treatments can help ease or delay some of the disease's symptoms.

Medicationand diet changes.Your child's doctor may suggest drugs and changes to your child’s diet tolower cholesterolor preventblood clots. A low dose of aspirin every day can help.Growth hormonecan help build height and weight.

Physical andoccupational therapy.A specially planned exercise program can help your child keep moving if they havestiff jointsor hip problems.

Surgery.Some children may have anangioplasty, a minimally invasive procedure in which doctors insert a stent to widen an artery to allow blood to flow more easily. Heart valve replacement surgery also may be necessary for people with the disease who develop a narrowed aortic valve, a condition called aortic stenosis. This can happen in those who live longer with the disease as a result of taking lonafarnib.


--- Living With Progeria ---


The following tips can help people with progeria live more comfortably:

Stay hydrated.Dehydration, particularly during illness and hot weather, is common in people with progeria. Make sure your child drinks plenty of water and other liquids.

Eat small but frequent meals.Doing so should help to get enough calories, which can be difficult for people with progeria. Focus on nutritious, high-calorie foods. A nutritionist can help develop a healthy eating plan.

Get regular exercise.Your doctor can tell you what types of physical activity will be safe and effective for your child.

Wear comfortable shoes or shoe inserts.Cushioned shoes and inserts can help ease the foot discomfort that can result from lost body fat.

Use sunscreen.Liberally apply broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 every 2 hours or more often when swimming or sweating. Cover all exposed skin, including the scalp.

Learn and socialize.Progeria does not impact how well the brain works, and kids with the disease benefit from school, both for learning and the opportunity to be with other kids.

Make adjustments in the home.Lower the height of light switches, faucets, and other things to make them more accessible. This allows for more independence in the home. More comfortable furniture also may be necessary. An occupational therapist can help determine your child’s needs and how to address them.

Get help with coping.Support groups and mental health therapists can help with the emotional burdens of the disease. TheProgeria Research Foundationoffers a private online community for family, caregivers, and others involved in the disease.
