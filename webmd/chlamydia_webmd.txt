--- Chlamydia Treatments ---


Chlamydia is curable. Because it’s abacterial infection, doctors can treat it withantibiotics. If you have chlamydia, your doctor will prescribe oral antibiotics, such asazithromycin(Zithromax) ordoxycycline.

With treatment, your infection should clear up in about a week or two. It’s important to finish all of your antibiotics, even if you feel better.

If you have a vagina and yourchlamydia infectionis severe, youmay need treatment in a hospital, IV antibiotics (medicine given through a vein), and pain medicine.

75% of those assigned female at birth and 50% of those assigned male at birth won't show symptoms of chlamydia.

It’s important for your partner(s) to get treated as well, so you can avoid getting infected again and prevent spreading the infection to others.

After you finish the antibiotics, you should get retested after 3 months to be sure the infection is cured. This is particularly important if you aren’t sure your partner(s) were treated. But do get tested even if your partner(s) were treated. Don’t have sex until you’re sure both you and your partner(s) are no longer infected.

How long will I test positive for chlamydia after treatment?

You may test positive for 4 weeks after treatment for chlamydia, even though your infection will probably clear up sooner than that.

Can you get chlamydia again after treatment?

After your chlamydia is treated and cured, it’s possible to get reinfected. This is why your partner(s) should also get treatment if you get diagnosed with chlamydia.
