--- What Are the Treatments for Heartburn? ---


Your health care provider may suggest antacids for occasional heartburn. Sometimes, more potentmedicationssuch as H2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors may be needed, especially for persistent symptoms. Both prescription and over-the-counter choices are available. Rarely, surgery is recommended to prevent reflux and heartburn. The primary objective of treatment is to identify the cause of the heartburn so it can be avoided in the future.

Over-the-counter antacids are commonly used to neutralize stomach acid. If antacids don't quell the symptoms, yourhealth careprovider may recommend an over-the-countermedicationcalled an H2 blocker such ascimetidine(Tagamet), andfamotidine(Pepcid,Zantac 360). Stronger, prescription-strength antacids are also available. (Note that the H2 blocker ranitidine was removed from the market in 2020 after it was found to contain a cancer causing agent.)

If heartburn symptoms persist, your health care provider can turn to drugs called proton pump inhibitors to reduce the stomach's production of acid. These includedexlansoprazole(Dexilant),esomeprazole(Nexium),lansoprazole(Prevacid),omeprazole(Prilosec,Zegerid),pantoprazole(Protonix), orrabeprazole(Aciphex). Some of these are available over-the-counter. Drugs that make the stomach empty faster may also be prescribed, such asmetoclopramide(Metozolv,Reglan)

When all else fails, surgery may be required to repair the lower esophageal sphincter. This surgery can now be done using a minimally invasive laparoscope and usually requires only a short hospital stay.
