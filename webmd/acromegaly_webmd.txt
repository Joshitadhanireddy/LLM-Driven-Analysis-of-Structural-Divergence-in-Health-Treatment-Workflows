--- Acromegaly Treatment ---


Your doctor will work with you to come up with the best treatment plan, taking into account your age, health, and how far along your condition is.

There are three ways to treat acromegaly:

  - Surgery
  - Medicine
  - Radiation


--- Surgery ---


Surgery is often the first treatment for people with large tumors affecting important areas, especially if they’re pressing on nerves that harm your vision. The surgeon will remove the tumor from the base of the brain. To get to it, they'll make a small cut in your nose or the inside of your upper lip. In some cases, your doctor may have you take medicine before the surgery to shrink the tumor.

After the surgery, your doctor will measure your hormones and do imaging of the area where the tumor was removed. Your symptoms may start to get better after only a few days.


--- Acromegaly medications ---


Your doctor may recommend taking one of these medicines after surgery to help control your acromegaly and bring hormone levels back to normal:

  - Somatostatin analogs (lanreotide, octreotide, or pasireotide)
  - Growth hormone receptor antagonists (pegvisomant)
  - Dopamine agonists (cabergoline, bromocriptine)

Those drugs either lower the level of growth hormone in your blood or block its effects on your body.


--- What is surgery isn't an option? ---


If surgery doesn't work for you or isn't an option, your doctor may offer palsonify (paltusotine). It's a new pill that you can take once a day to treat your acromegaly. This medicine acts like your natural hormone, somatostatin, to attach to its receptor and bring down your GH and IGF-1 levels. This helps ease your symptoms and may also slow down the progress of your condition.


--- Radiation therapy ---


Radiation helps if you have parts of a tumor left after surgery or if you need more help lowering GH levels after taking medicine. It can help stop the tumor from growing and your body from making too much GH. Types of radiation therapy include:

Conventional radiation therapy.You get this type of radiation therapy every weekday for 4-6 weeks. It could take 10 or more years for you to recognize this type of therapy’s effect on your body.

Proton beam therapy.This involves sending a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor while avoiding the normal tissue. You’ll have several treatments, but the overall treatment time is usually less than conventional radiation therapy.

Stereotactic radiosurgery.You’ll get one very high dose of radiation targeted to your tumor cells while avoiding the healthy tissue. This type of therapy could bring your GH levels back to normal in about 5 years.
