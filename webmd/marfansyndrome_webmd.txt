  - Geneticists
  - Surgeons
  - Cardiologists
  - Dental specialists
  - Eyespecialists (ophthalmologists)
  - Orthopedists
  - Pulmonologists
  - Mental health professionals
  - Dermatologists

Marfan syndrome treatment

You’ll need a treatment plan designed for your specific needs. Some people need regular follow-up appointments with their doctor and, during the growth years, routine cardiovascular, eye, and orthopedic exams.

Your treatment will depend on what’s affected. For example:

  - To treateye problems, you may need glasses, contacts, or surgery.
  - To treat skeletal problems, you may need an orthopedic brace, shoe inserts, or spinal fusion surgery.

Heart issues may require medication or surgery.

Marfan syndrome medications

Doctors don’t typically use medications to treat Marfan syndrome. But your doctor may prescribe a beta-blocker, which lowers the forcefulness of your heartbeat and the pressure in the arteries, preventing or slowing the enlargement of the aorta. Beta-blocker therapy is usually started when the patient is young.

Some people can’t take beta-blockers because they haveasthmaor because of side effects, which may include drowsiness, weakness,headaches, a slowed heartbeat, swelling of the hands and feet, ortrouble breathingand sleeping. In these cases, you may take a medication called a calcium channel blocker.

Surgery for Marfan syndrome

Surgery for Marfan syndrome is aimed at preventing aortic dissection or rupture and treating problems affecting your heart's valves, which control the flow of blood in and out of your heart and between its chambers.

The decision to perform surgery is based on the size of the aorta, expected normal size of the aorta, rate of aortic growth, age, height, gender, andfamily historyof aortic dissection. Surgery involves replacing the dilated portion of the aorta with a graft, a piece of man-made material used in place of the damaged or weak area of the blood vessel.

A leaky aortic or mitral valve (the valve that controls the flow of blood between the two left chambers of the heart) can damage the left ventricle (the lower chamber of the heart that is the main pumping chamber) orcause heart failure. In these cases, you need surgery to replace or repair the affected valve. If it’s done early, before the valves are damaged, the aortic or mitral valve may be repaired. If the valves are damaged, they may need to be replaced.

Talk with a surgeon who has experience with surgery for Marfan syndrome. People who have surgery for Marfan syndrome still need life-long follow-up care to prevent complications.
