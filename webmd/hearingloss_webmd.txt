--- Hearing Loss Treatments ---


How you’re treated depends on the type and source of your hearing loss. Prompt medical treatment for sudden hearing loss may raise your chance of recovery.

  - Surgerymay reverse hearing loss caused by otosclerosis, scar tissue, or infection, while Ménière's disease is sometimes treatable with medication and a different diet.
  - Antibioticscan often clear up hearing loss caused by infection.
  - Changing medicationsmay help if you think your hearing loss stems from one you’re taking. Talk with your doctor about different drug options.
  - Removing ear waxwith suction or a small looped tool can reverse hearing loss caused by a blockage.
  - A hearing aidhelps most people with permanent hearing loss. You typically wear these tiny instruments in or behind your ear to make sounds louder. Things do sound different through a hearing aid, so talk to your doctor to set realistic goals.
  - Other sound-enhancing technologiesthat may improve your hearing include personal listening systems that allow you to tune in to what you want to hear and mute other sounds. TV-listening systems make it possible for you to hear the television or radio without turning up the volume. Different kinds of phone-amplifying devices as well as captioned phones that let you read what your caller is saying make conversations possible on home and mobile phones.
  - Cochlear implantsare used mainly with young children, but they're becoming more popular among older adults with profound hearing loss.
