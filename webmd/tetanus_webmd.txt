--- Tetanus Treatment ---


There isn't a lab test for tetanus. Your doctor will make the diagnosis by looking at your symptoms and asking about your medical and vaccination history. Your doctor may order lab tests if they need to check that your symptoms aren't due to some other disease.

Treatment for tetanus usually requires hospital care and the following:

  - Tetanus immune globulin (medication)
  - Intensive wound care
  - Drugs to control muscle spasms
  - Antibiotics
  - Tetanus vaccination

Tetanus immune globulin

This medicine can treat or prevent tetanus. It's made from blood and gives your body the antibodies it needs to neutralize the tetanus toxin until your immune system can produce its own antibodies. Treatment involves giving one injection into a muscle.

Tetanus immune globulin only works on toxins that haven't yet attacked nerve tissues. So, if you visit the doctor about a serious wound and your tetanus vaccine was not up to date, they would give you a tetanus booster but may also give you tetanus immune globulin to protect you until the vaccine starts working (usually about 2 weeks).

Medicine for tetanus

In addition to tetanus immune globulin, you'll usually get antibiotics such asmetronidazoleor penicillin to kill theC. tetanibacteria.

To control muscle spasms, you may be given a sedative such asdiazepam.

To manage tetanus complications, such as fluctuating blood pressure, rapid heartbeat, and hypothermia, you may getmagnesiumalong with a sedative.

Your hospital team will make sure you can breathe properly and that a feeding tube provides high-calorie nutrition since muscle contractions use up a lot of energy. They'll also keep loud sounds, touch, and bright light to a minimum so as not to trigger any spasms. You'll probably need physical therapy after you're feeling better because the spasms affect your muscles.

Wound care

Wound care is an essential part of tetanus treatment. Tetanus wounds need to be cleaned to remove dirt or foreign objects and debrided, meaning that dead tissue must be removed. Otherwise, the bacteria will continue to spread in your body.


--- Tetanus Vaccination ---


Having had tetanus doesn't give you immunity from the condition. Your doctor will give you a vaccination so you don't get tetanus again. Although most people get a tetanus shot as babies as part of theDTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, or whooping cough) vaccine, everyone should:

  - Get a tetanus booster shot every 10 years
  - Get a tetanus booster if they have a contaminated wound and it's 5 years or more since the last shot (or they can't remember when the last shot was)
